ogaden_war_news.1.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Somali forces in collaboration with the Western Somali Liberation Front (WSLF) have launched a surprise invasion of the Ogaden region of Somalia. The Ogaden region has long been a point of contention between Somalia and Ethiopia, while being a longstanding part of the former Ethiopian Empire the population is majority Somali. The WSLF had been for the prior few years launching sporadic raids and attacks in the region in support of joining Somalia. The instability rampant in Ethiopia since the coup by the communist Derg has emboldened ethnic secessionists in Ethiopia to seek freedom from Addis Ababa. Further complicating the conflict is that both Somalia and Ethiopia are currently backed by the Soviet Union. The world awaits how the situation develops and how Moscow will react."
ogaden_war_news.2.d:0 "The Somali invasion of Ethiopia has put Moscow in a tough position. Both nations were formerly aligned and backed by the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact and COMECON. However, the Soviet Union has indicated that they would be halting all support for Somalia and would be fully backing the Ethiopian Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC) in their fight to retake their sovereign land. Rumors of major weapon shipments inbound to Addis Ababa abound along with potential shipments of supplies from East Germany and Poland. Additionally, reports have been leaked that the Central Intelligence Agency believes Havana will send troops to Ethiopia at the behest of Moscow. Time will tell how these predictions age and what the reaction by the west shall be."

Both nations were formerly aligned and backed by the Soviet Union and other members of the Warsaw Pact and COMECON. However, the Soviet Union has indicated that they would be halting all support for Ethiopia and would be backing the Somali goal of annexing the Ogaden region. While no official reasoning was given, analysts believe that Soviet policymakers have decided that the Ethiopian government is too insatiable and that the nation is past the point of being stabilized without significant costs. Rumors of major weapon shipments inbound to Mogadishu abound along with potential shipments of supplies from East Germany and Poland. Additionally, reports have been leaked that the Central Intelligence Agency believes Havana will send troops to Somalia at the behest of Moscow. Time will tell how these predictions age and what the reaction by the west shall be."
ogaden_war_news.4.d:0 "After the Soviet announcement of their support for the Ethiopian Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC), Cuban leader Fidel Castro announced his intention to deploy over 16,000 troops under the command of General Arnaldo Ochoa to Ethiopia. The forces, along with accompanying air and armor assets are intended to serve as a training force for the Ethiopian Army along with being actively deployed to combat in the Ogaden region. This move has been seen as a major escalation in Cuba’s ongoing African intervention campaigns, especially in light of Cuba’s larger intervention in Angola. Analysts have questioned whether this is further straining the Cuban military given the tens of thousands already deployed in Angola are rumored to be in excess of 30% of the entire Cuban army."

ogaden_war_news.6.d:0 "Following the Soviet announcement of suspension of support for Somalia over its invasion of the Ogaden region of Ethiopia, American President [USA.GetLeader] has announced their support for the Somalian government. The President noted that the administration would begin providing material and intelligence support to the Somalis in the hope of Somalia resisting Soviet influence and securing their rightful territory, freeing it from the “genocidal tyranny of the Derg”. The Soviet Union, Ethiopian government and Cuba have decried the move as supporting the blatant violation of Ethiopian sovereignty. This comes as rumors of potential Cuban intervention into the conflict are reaching a fever pitch. In other news, international aid groups and have expressed concern over the possibility of a famine."
ogaden_war_news.7.d:0 "Following the Soviet announcement of suspension of support of Ethiopia in light of their newfound war with Somalia, American President [USA.GetLeader] has announced a new policy of supporting Ethiopia in exchange for concessions. This move has proven to be controversial domestically given the Ethiopian government Marxist orientation. That said, with the Soviet Union supporting Ethiopia’s enemy, Somalia there is a unique opportunity to regain western influence in the Horn of Africa in light of the coups in the region over the last decade. Still, this move will likely not serve to drastically improve the internal situation in Ethiopia given the orientation of the various armed opposition movements against the government. That said, given Ethiopia’s manpower advantage in conjunction with western weaponry could prove to be a potent force capable of rebuffing Somali advances."
ogaden_war_news.8.d:0 "Following a major months-long campaign, the Ethiopian military has managed to completely reverse their prior losses and secure control over the entirety of the Ogaden region. Analysts have credited heavy foreign support for the Ethiopian forces as playing a decisive role in their comeback. With the Ethiopian forces halting their advance at the border the question now turns to what the future of Somalia is. The loss has destabilized the current government of Siad Barre and possible opposition from hostile clans is now reportedly of a concern. Meanwhile, the Ethiopian government is still embattled in a vicious series of internal conflicts that still threaten to tear the nation apart. Regardless, this is a major victory for the Derg in their quest to ensure their rule across all of Ethiopia."
ogaden_war_news.9.d:0 "Despite several attempts to retake the Ogaden region, the Ethiopian military has been unable to achieve a breakthrough. While the ruling Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC) has not announced a halt to their attempts to retake the region, it has become abundantly clear to the international community that the Ethiopian military is reorienting away from the Ogaden conflict to focus on the Eritrea rebellion and the internal conflict against the Derg regime. Meanwhile in Mogadishu, President Siad Barre has declared victory over Ethiopia and has announced a formal annexation of Ogaden. The victorious campaign has shored up public support for Barre and silenced much of the opposition against his regime. More concerning to the international community is Barre’s promise to further restore Somalia’s border, raising concerns over potential actions against Djibouti and Kenya."
ogaden_war_news.10.d:0 "Following a major months-long campaign, the Ethiopian military has managed to mostly retake most of the Ogaden region. However, Somali forces have managed to hold off advances in the Haud region which was only annexed by Ethiopia in the aftermath of World War II. The conflict seems to be dying down into a stalemate. This result has further destabilized Ethiopia and provided mixed benefits to Somalia. While Somali leader Siad Barre has declared the war a great victory, Somalia has taken major military losses for rather limited territorial gains. However, as Somalia has managed to take part of Ogaden, Barre has managed to prevent any serious slippage of public support. Consequently, the communist junta in Addis Ababa continues to lose popular support as ethnic secessionists and ideological partisans continue to gain steam."
ogaden_war_news.11.d:0 "The ancient enemy of Ethiopia, Somalia has finally managed what once would have been considered impossible. The Somali army has successfully managed to breach the defenses of Addis Ababa. The leadership of the Derg have fled the city but their current whereabouts are unknown. That said, Somali forces have announced their intention to withdraw back to Ogaden and secure their gains. President Siad Barre has declared an end to the war and a nationwide celebration for their decisive victory of the war. In the power vacuum in Addis Ababa Imperial Prince, former Governor-General of Tigray, Ras Mengesha Seyoum and his supporters in the Ethiopian Democratic Union were able to seize control, setting themselves up as a larger player in the increasingly chaotic multifactorial civil war plaguing Ethiopia. Washington has announced their support and intention to being arming the Ethiopian Democratic Union and have pledged to aid in their endeavor to liberate Ethiopia from communism and restore stability to the region."
ogaden_war_news.12.d:0 "Following the Ethiopian forces victory in retaking the Ogaden region, Ethiopian government forces continued on and invaded northern Somalia with the backing of members of the expatriate community. As the fighting subsides, the Ethiopian government has announced their intention to establish an independent Somaliland government that will be allied with Addis Ababa. Newly announced Somaliland leader, President Admed Mohamed Gulaid, a member of the Somali Islamic Democratic Party has recently arrived in Hargeisa with several others to hash out a final agreement with the Derg on the new Somaliland government. Meanwhile, Somalia refuses to accept the new state and various foreign nations have also announced their intention to block recognition of Somaliland, decrying the state as a puppet of Ethiopia and little better then the Bantustans of South Africa."
ogaden_war_news.13.d:0 "In a massive turnabout, the Ethiopian Army announced the formal surrender of the remaining Somali forces in the capital of Mogashidu. Given the implosion of the Ethiopian military in the Ogaden region at the start of the conflict, this is quite the shocking outcome. Siad Barre and his closest allies have fled to the countryside vowing to continue to resist the new government. On that note, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed a former colonel who defected to the anti-Barre resistance as the war took a turn for the worse has been installed as the new interim leader of Somalia by the victorious Derg. The stunning Ethiopian victory has not only reinforced Ethiopia’s role as a major regional power but also put to rest some of the domestic opposition to the Derg regime given an upswell of patriotic fervor given the decisive defeat of a historical enemy of Ethiopia."
ogaden_war_foreign.1.d:0 "Unfortunate news has come in from the Horn of Africa. Somalia has launched a full-scale invasion of the Ogaden region of Somalia. The Ogaden has been a long disputed piece of territory between Somalia and Ethiopia. Despite a majority Somali population, Ethiopia still holds the territory despite Somalia’s claims that it is their rightful land. Unfortunately, while both nations are aligned with us, we must make a decision on whom to support. Either option will have drawbacks and likely lead to alienating the other nation. Ethiopia is the larger nation and broadly speaking has the most capability to be a useful strategic asset in the long run. However, the instability in the nation will make this a costly endeavor and also require significant support to stabilize the nation. On the other hand, Somalia is currently more stable and has been aligned with us for a longer period of time, but is more unorthodox ideologically and has a much lower manpower pool then Ethiopia. How should we proceed?"
ogaden_war_foreign.2.d:0 "Following the coups in Somalia and Ethiopia over the last decade we have largely lost any influence in the Horn of Africa. This has been a major cause for our government in recent years. However we have a new opportunity to restore some of our influence in the region. Somalia has invaded Ethiopia with the goal of taking the Somali majority Ogaden region. While both nations were aligned with Moscow, the Soviet Union has announced their support for Somalia, alienating Ethiopia. While the Ethiopian junta is socialist, surely we could outreach to the newly alienated government and seek concessions in exchange for significant military aid to combat the Somali threat to their territorial integrity. On the other hand, this would surely alienate some hardliners against the Ethiopian regime and could be a political landmine in Congress. How should we proceed?"

How should we proceed?"
