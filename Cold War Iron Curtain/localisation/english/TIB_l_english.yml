TIB_KMT_50s:0 "Kuomintang Tibet Focus Tree"

POLITICS_TENZIN_GYATSO_WARLORD_50s_DESC:0 "§gAfter the demise of the 13th Dalai Lama, three search teams were sent out to the north-east, the east, and the south-east to locate the new incarnation when the boy who was to become the 14th Dalai Lama was about two years old. Tenzin was only a toddler when the Qinghai warlord Ma Bufang was diplomatically bribing the Lhasa government in order for them to return to Tibet. As soon as they were out of Ma Bufang's area, he was officially declared to be the 14th Dalai Lama by the Kashag, and after ten weeks of travel he arrived in Lhasa on 8 October 1939. After his enthronement, he would spend most of his childhood between the Potala Palace and Norbulingka, his summer residence. After the emergence of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War, it is uncertain what his future role in Tibet will look like if the Kuomintang decides to invade Tibet.§!\n\n§CClique Explanation:§!\n\n§gAfter the Xinhai Revolution, the region of Tibet declared independence from the newly founded Republic of China. For the next 36 years, the 13th Dalai Lama and the regents who succeeded him governed Tibet. During this time, Tibet fought Chinese warlords for control of the ethnically Tibetan areas in Xikang and Qinghai. The Kuomintang Government of the Republic of China under Chiang Kai-shek has already taken advantage of Tibetan negligence to expand its reach into the territory. In 1941, Chiang Kai-Shek noted in his diary that Tibet would be among the territories which shall be re-integrated into China following the conclusion of World War II.§!"

Tibet_Kuomintang.6.b:0 "Tien Chung-chin is the suitable Succession Option."

Tibet_Kuomintang.7.d:0 "The Republic of China’s Integration of Xizang (Tibet) by the Kuomintang is the act of triumph of Chiang Kai Shek’s National Revolution Program with the Three Principles of People of Sun Yat-Sen. The post-10th October 1911 Revolution Chinese Government failed to unite China. The Yuan Shikai Traitor Imperial Government failed too and the 1917-1928 Beiyang Government under Duan Qirui’s Anhui Leadership, Cao Kun’s Zhili Leadership, and the failed Triumvirate-Governorship of Zhang Zuolin’s Fengtian Leadership failed to counter independence of Tibet in 1913 by the XIIIth Dalai Lama. But with the success of the Northern Expedition, The Anti-Japanese War, and the securitization of the Republican Government from Communists, Tibet is the new victory for the National Revolution and Chinese Unification."
Tibet_Kuomintang.8.d:0 "With the Growing unrest between the Monks and the influential Bureaucrat Tsarong Dzasa, a delegation was sent to Tsarong Dzara Monks in Sera Monastery where in 1947 the Sera Monastery Incident Happened. It was one of the Kashag Faction wars with Taktra Rinpoche who was Pro-Independence and Radreng Hutuktu who was pro-Republic of China. After some hard negotiations about Kashag’s authority and the Dalai Lama's power, the delegation was insulted like in 1934 Huang Musong’s Delegation and was defended by some of Radreng's old support. This meeting with Nationalists was Worrying…"
Tibet_Kuomintang.9.d:0 "With the failed negotiation, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission transmits the information to Nanjing. Liu Wenhui, the Governor of Xikang sent us a letter where he was worried about the Tibetan Situation by remembering the border clashes and the instability in his provincial administration. Liu Wenhui with Yang Sen ROCAF are ready to intervene if the order could collapse. Nanjing call MTAC to maintain order with an increased Police Control near Lhasa Monastery. Chiang Kai-Shek Sent a message to Kashag to appease the members of the government with our Network of pro-China Monks of Gendun Chophel Reformist Lines thought."
Tibet_Kuomintang.10.d:0 "Riots in Lhasa, and the increased Police presence, created a sentiment of military occupation, and the Tibetan Nationalists launched riots and called Kashag to kick out the Mongolian and Tibetan Affair Commission Local Governorship and calling for a second independence by expelling the pro-Chinese Kashag and their ties with Tibet Improvement Party (TIP), a Reformist Tridemist Tibetan Party who is pro-Republic of China integration and for the ‘Five Races Under One Union’ Project. In Lhasa streets, some chaotic scenes happened, and some of our violent Police anti-rioter tactics increased the Tibetan riot and the decrease of order."
Tibet_Kuomintang.11.d:0 "The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) announced that the work begins for the construction of the Xizang Aera Adminstrtaion, some advisors like Tien Chung-chin and Yu Ching-tang who started with bureaucrat and their connection to Tibetan Improvement Party (TIP). A lot of hard work will start with the unstable domestic situation, religious political influence, and the influence of anti-Chinese Kashag member and their Sinophobic Rhetoric. With National Reconstruction directed by the Nanjing Government, Xizang (Tibet) needs a lot of recovery in society and industry to gain full integration."
Tibet_Kuomintang.12.d:0 "[MAXIMUM ALERT] The rioters start to attack Kuomintang and Chinese Symbols. Moreover, they start to block the principal road to Qinghai and Xikang to block the Chinese Support Trucks. Attacks begin against the Chinese MTAC member, Police personnel, and their families. Some old Tibetan Army Soldiers who have muskets started to shoot some policemen who started crackdown rioters with Sinophobic Speeches. Furthermore, some sources of Kashag announced that pro-independence monks under Tsarong Dzasa wanted to march on Potala Palace. In MTAC two Factions have their plan: Some want the Intervention of ROCAF in Xizang (Tibet) or launch negotiations with Kashag before Dzasa reaches Potala Palace as the Huang Musong Strategy."
Tibet_Kuomintang.13.d:0 "[MAXIMUM ALERT] Following, the riot and the tension in the MTAC and the low support of our local government in the Kashag. Some of our communication is closed. A total reorganization will be started with the support of Liu Wenhui’s Xikang and Chiang Kai Shek’s Nanjing Central Government. The local MTAC Council will attempt to restore order with the help of all pro-Chinese Tibetan Authorities and stop the riot to keep order."
Tibet_Kuomintang.14.d:0 "To Counter Tsarong Dzasa Nationalists, Tien Chung-chin with an MTAC Delegation has been sent to Potala Palace under Chaos to attempt to Negotiate with the help of the 10th Panchen Lama and the Taktra Rinpoche Pro-Independence Support. The Debate starts with the question of Dalai Lama's leadership. The Kuomintang Plans for Tibet are from old Wang Jingwei’s Government with some blurry points about Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Governorship Power and the potential decrease and end of Kashag Autonomy. But during Huang Musong’s mission to Tibet, Tibetan Kashag sent a proposition with Ten Points for a Xizang (Tibet) Autonomous Government. With this situation, we can persuade Monks to accept their project as a maximum concession or prevent their support to Nationalists by making more concessions but the time is short before Dzasa arrives in Potala Palace."
Tibet_Kuomintang.15.d:0 "[MAXIMUM ALERT] Before Tien Chung-chin left the meeting room, Chaos near Potala Palace. The Worst thing happened, Dzasa’s and Taktra’s Nationalists launched the assault on Potala Palace with a rumor of Dalai Lama's support. With this information, the interventionist faction of MTAC calls Tien to send a message to Kangding and Nanjing to call the ROCAF against the Nationalists. We need to keep the Authority to continue the National Revolution!"
Tibet_Kuomintang.16.d:0 "In the Street, the Chaos Continued, and the former Tibetan Military attacks launched counterattacks of Policemen creating a panic movement and gained more support from the Nationalists Monks. Some Tibetan Civils helped the former military with melee Weapons on Policemen and rumors were bad, Kashag and Dalai Lama could start negotiating with Nationalists and prepare a new Kashag to gain a second de facto independence and have a project to reach de jure independence. The situation is out of control…"
Tibet_Kuomintang.17.d:0 "From Kangding 150,000 men of Yang Sen’s Xikang Division start to enter in this morning in Lhasa. Some former military men surrender and the Police start arresting all suspicious people. In Potala Palace, the Taktra Rinpoche support started to flee Lhasa to survive the new military administration. Nanjing announced that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission failed to his mission and Huang Musong’s mission Knowledge was not useful to maintain order in Xizang (Tibet). Chiang Kai-Shek announces that Yang Sen will restore order by military rule and will continue the struggle for Chinese Unification. The MTAC’s Governorship will be restored after the reconstruction policy by the ROCAF Authority. "
Tibet_Kuomintang.18.d:0 "Following hard Negotiations, the Lhasa crisis was adverted by using the Ten Propositions for integration proposed by Kashag during the Huang Musong Mission. Here are the Points: -1) Tibet shall remain an integral part of China, while the Chinese must promise not to change the Tibetan administrative system. -2) Tibet will follow Chinese Authority, laws, and regulations provided it does not harm the Tibetan dual religious-political government. -3) The Tibetan dual system of government will remain, and China will not interfere with Tibetan civil and military power. -4) Tibet will continue friendly relations with all its neighboring states. -5) Only one Chinese representative may be stationed in Tibet, and his retinue shall not exceed twenty-five. -6) Recognition of the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation, his enthronement, the selection and inauguration of the regent, and the appointment of officials shall be conducted by the Kashag as at present. -7) Military forces to be stationed on the borders of Tibet for defense purposes shall be dispatched by Tibet as at present. -8) Those Chinese people who have resided in Tibet since 1912 shall continue to be governed by Tibet. -9) To avoid further possible disputes, the territories in Amdo and Kham that originally belonged to Tibet but were occupied by the Chinese will be turned over to Lhasa at the earliest possible date. -10) The Chinese government will not give asylum to any Tibetan, ecclesiastical or secular, who has rebelled against the Tibetan Government and escaped to China. || But we all know that all of these points can’t be stored so with MTAC Governorship and the new Autonomous Kashag, a status quo starts."
Tibet_Kuomintang.19.d:0 "The Rumor was true, Dalai Lama supported nationalists of influential politician Tsarong Dzasa and nationalist monks. His declaration stated a future Kashag reorganization and the kick of the Chinese MTAC Governorship. In Lhasa Street, the Police lost control of the street and the monks entered in Potala Palace where a Taktra supporter who bribed Dalai Lama to start the future reorganization with a transitory council to end the Xizang Autonomous Government, Tien Chung-chin was wounded by nationalists. Moreover, some information from the Ngari local committee announced a new emerging force by the Tibetan Communist Party of Phuntsok Wangyal with the support of PLA Remanent and the East Turkestan Republic."
Tibet_Kuomintang.20.d:0 "Following the loss of control, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission fled to Kangding where Liu Wenhui without preparation had information on ‘The Second Kashag’s Declaration of Independence’. the Xizang Administration Policemen were arrested and the Tibetan army started to reorganize. With Yu Ching-tang's advice, Liu Wenhui called Nanjing to prepare a total invasion of Xizang and annex it as a Province by ending all nationalist and autonomous ideas. For Liu who was a partisan of moderate line and negotiation with Kashag against the Chiang Kai Shek and Wang Jingwei old Government, the time for negotiations is finished and China must be united. In Tibet, Tsarong Dzasa announced the creation of Provisional Kashag to maintain the independence stance and began to launch emergency action against the Chinese answers with his independence proclamation."
Tibet_Kuomintang.21.d:0 "[BUG]"
Tibet_Kuomintang.22.d:0 "Following Yang Sen’s ROCAF intervention, the military administration needs to be clear about his intention, the Huang Musong’s moderate line of negotiation with Kashag is finished. Yang Sen stated that Huang Musong’s Doctrine failed and that the unique path to Chinese unification and stabilization would be under the universal Minquan values of Sun Yat-Sen. This will be a path to empower the secularization of Tibet and total control of religious activity. Following Jiang Zhiyu's thoughts who was on the Huang Musong mission said that Huang failed to empower Chinese influence and persuade Kashag to submit and the unique solution was the ‘National Revolutionary Army’ Intervention. Lin Donghai, a former bureaucrat of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Huang Musong made too many concessions without imposing Chiang Kai-Shek’s Government propositions."
Tibet_Kuomintang.23.d:0 "After the Lhasa Incident and Negotiation with Tibetans who gained Autonomous Kashag status, the new governor Tien Chung-chin from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) needed to restore the social and societal situation. With the Tridemist Values with the Legacy of “Five Races Under One Union”, Tien will start the integration of Xizang (Tibet) in the Republic of China as an Equal Ethnicity to Hans. Alphabetization, School Program, Introduction to Mandarin, and End of Sinophobic Rhetoric are the main plans of the Governorship of Tien Chung-chin. Furthermore, the Political Influence of Religion will be stopped to stabilize Tibet with a Status Quo with the Autonomous Kashag. Before beginning Provincial Reconstruction, the social peace as the Minquan Principle needs to be restored."
Tibet_Kuomintang.24.d:0 "The success of maintaining order with civil government is proof that Republican China can end its unification policy by force. Following Sun Yat-Sen’s wishes, the Tibetan government can keep its culture and tradition because Tibetan Culture is now part of Chinese culture. Moreover, as the Minquan Principle with the influence of the “Du Contrat Social” of Rousseau, a French Philosopher, the Tibetans can have a choice of their destiny without traditional pressure and can begin to integrate the multi-ethnic society of the Republic of China."
Tibet_Kuomintang.25.d:0 "Following Social Recovery, Tien Chung-chin finished his work for the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and named a successor: Yu Ching-tang. Yu Ching-tang needs to do one of the hardest work for Tibetan Integration in the Republic of China, The Economic and Industrial Integration. Water Infrastructure, End of Feudal Practices, Mechanization of Agriculture, and National Infrastructures to connect them to Qinghai and Xikang and create new places for Industrial Investment. Moreover, Yu Ching-tang with his political experience in Kuomintang and Domestic Policies, will start to approach the Autonomous Kashag to try to end the Status Quo and continue to maintain stability in Xizang."
Tibet_Kuomintang.26.d:0 "With the status quo about Ten Points for Tibetan integration, Yu Ching-tang needs after his long work for industrial and agricultural reforms in Xizang (Tibet) to launch negotiations with Autonomous Kashag about claims of former ‘State of Tibet’ with Xizang region and Qinghai Region, the military question and the question of Foreign policies. With the success of the modernization plan of Yu and the social recovery of Tien, the Dalai Lama began to give better support to pro-Chinese Kashag members and TIP members to decrease the nationalist influence who could lead a dual power with the 10th Panchen Lama and begin a revision of Ten points. For eviting some new nationalist growth we are open to expanding negotiations or imposing our point of view which can lead to maintaining the status quo."
Tibet_Kuomintang.27.d:0 "With a failure to end the Status Quo about Governance Influence with Autonomous Kashag, Yu Ching-tang fails his last mission. Chiang Kai-Shek and Executive Yuan worried about a second nationalist revolt that could lead to a second Lhasa crisis and send Wu Zhongxin to restore order in Lhasa. Wu Zhongxin has a mission to keep the status Quo to maintain a weakened Nationalist Fever in Monks. Chiang Kai-Shek has bribed Wu to increase with the help of Liu Wenhui’s Xikang and Ma Bufang’s Qinghai to send some ROCAF and Police Garnissons to maintain order. But Wu with the help of the Tibet Improvement Party (TIP) and the medium loyalty of Autonomous Kashag has a project to increase the modernization of Tibetan Cities and launch the boom of Provincial Economy"
Tibet_Kuomintang.28.d:0 "Following the new negotiations, we are in a good way to resolve the status quo with Autonomous Kashag with the help of Panchen Lama who can lead the Dalai Lama to keep his spiritual influence in the Xizang Administration on domestic decisions with the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission who can lead to a total integration peacefully in the Central Government and keep the Sun Yat-Sen’s National Revolution Project or take a pragmatist approach to preventing nationalists rhetoric by promote Panchen Lama as the Governor with keeping the dual power with Dalai Lama by accepting MTAC wishes. The new political situation will be an Autonomous Kashag with Dalai Lama as the spiritual leader who will lead all domestic policy about monasteries, tradition, and religious policies and the Xizang Government the industrial, military, and agriculture with the intervention of Autonomous Kashag when the law will touch the religious and tradition life."
Tibet_Kuomintang.29.d:0 "Following the independence declaration, Tsarong Dzasa Gouvernement begins the reorganization of Kashag for the incoming response of the Republic of China which begin to expel the pro-China Kashag members and launch emergency actions in society and external policies. For Foreign policy, we would start to establish ties with the Republic of India and formalize ties with the Kingdom of Bhutan and Nepal."
Tibet_Kuomintang.30.d:0 "The Republic of China announced the ending of all plans to intervene in Tibet with the help of India and the Huang Musong Thought supporter who counter-attacked the hardliners Chiang Kai-Shek's support for intervention. Following this news, Tibetan independence was securitized, and a new foreign recognition policy with the help of India. The Dzasa’s Kashag announces launching the end of the emergency policy and militarization of society to begin the National Recovery."
Tibet_Kuomintang.31.d:0 "With the worrying news from Lhasa, we need to decide to continue the struggle for the National Revolution. But the Republic of India with the support of the Reformist faction of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission called to end the conflict with Tibet by ending tensions and setting up the provincial border of Xikang for MTAC Argument. But with the Hardliner's influence and the ROCAF's influence. Chen Cheng, Hu Zongnan, Zhang Qun, and Chen Lifu call for an intervention to attack the potential imperialist intentions of India."
Tibet_Kuomintang.32.d:0 "After the Lhasa incident, Yang Sen proclaimed martial law and officially ended the multi-thought for monks and all autonomous monk organizations. ROCAF started to control the Drepung Monastery and Restore the pro-Chinese faction of Sera Monastery. Following the stabilization of the religious authority, we would begin to begin talks with MTAC and Panchen Lama to prepare for the restoration of civil administration. For prepare the restoration of civil rule, we would begin to launch the special Dang-Guo Policy for Tibet condition."
Tibet_Kuomintang.33.d:0 "Following the modernization of Xizang, we would begin to launch the restoration of civil administration. Nanjing orders are clear, maintain order, and finalize the integration in the Republic of China. But Nanjing didn’t give the plan to keep the autonomous rule or integration as a provincial administration. So Yang Sen will decide to preserve the local administration or apply a dogmatist way of the old Wang Jingwei’s civil government to integrate Tibet under the Central Government and unite China as a total unitary Republic."
Tibet_Kuomintang.34.d:0 "Xu Shiying was appointed as Governor, his mission is to maintain the local government and begin to appoint new laws about religions with the order of Nanjing and begin to side with TIP and Panchen Lama to end the tension between the Republic of China Government and the Tibetan People. Now Xizang (Tibet) as a Provincial de facto organization will start to draft the Chiang Kai-shek Tridemist project."
Tibet_Kuomintang.35.d:0 "Following the end of the Military Administration, we will start to implement the National Government Plan for Tibet since the 1930s with many propositions: 1. The traditional political system would be continued and it would permit Tibet to have autonomy. 2. China would not interfere with any administrative measures within the authority of autonomous Tibet. 3. Foreign affairs required unitary action, and all administrative matters that were nationwide in character were to be administered by China. 4. After the Chinese government implemented Tibet's autonomy, to exercise full sovereignty over a part of the nation (Tibet), the Chinese government was to appoint a high official to be stationed in Tibet as China's representative. On the one hand, he would carry out national administrative measures, and, on the other hand, would guide regional autonomy."
Tibet_Kuomintang.36.d:0 "With the end of the Hardline authority of Xu Shiying, Xizang begins to launch his recovery to integration into the National Revolution in the new half-century. Following the beginning of the control of Monks, the nationalist and the Communist Party of Tibet's Increased influence needs to be ended. The new governor Kuo Chi-chiao with his military experience after the Yang Sen military administration will start the transition to civil society with the control of a local military police to Drepung Monastery which is considered the last bastion of anti-ROC monks and nationalist bastion."
