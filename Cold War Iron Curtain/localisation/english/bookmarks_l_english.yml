 BM_HISTORY_TITLE:0 "Brief History"
 BOOKMARK_1980_NAME:0 "The New Cold War"
 BOOKMARK_1980_DESC:0 "In 1980, the world was in the grip of the Cold War, a tense standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union. Tensions ran high as both sides engaged in an ideological battle, with the specter of nuclear war looming large. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to renewed focus on military preparedness. Resistance movements, like the Solidarity movement in Poland, challenged Communist rule. The threat of nuclear conflict cast a shadow over international relations as both sides vied for power. "
 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Iron Curtain"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The post-war optimism of global cooperation and peace epitomized by the establishment of the United Nations has quickly evaporated. During the last war European empires exhausted not only their own blood and treasure but also that of their colonial territories. Now, colonized peoples across Africa and Asia are demanding independence. Globally, the United States and the Soviet Union now greatly surpass any other power. The beginnings of an ideological rivalry between the two states sees their wartime friendship quickly cool. Already lines are being drawn across Europe as an ideological partition increasingly separates the capitalist and communist regimes."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Great Britain fought for its very survival against Hitler and emerged victorious. Yet this victory came at a cost. Half of Europe under the Iron Curtain, the nation scarred by war, and the Empire precariously close to fading into history. It seems for Britain, the peace shall be as hard a fight as war. The memories of the Blitz fade away as the fear of Communism grips the hearts of the British Commonwealth."
 CAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Canada left the Great War as a nation, and has left the last war as a power in her own right. Increasingly independent of London, Canada has become a prosperous nation with a strong economy and modern military. For the first time in her history, Canada has the chance to write her own destiny. Will the True North stay strong and free?"
 KOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finally free of both US and Japanese occupation, the newly established Republic of Korea was hopeful for peaceful reunification with their separated countrymen above the 38th parallel. But after the suspicious assassination of the only senior politician willing to negotiate with the North and staunch anti-Communist Syngman Rhee winning the presidency, dreams of peace were shattered, and the peninsula's fate shall be drawn with blood."
 WGR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Germany began the Second World War under the wicked ambitions of Adolf Hitler, but ended it a conquered nation. The post-war occupation of Germany is nearing its end; a permanent split between a western-aligned west and a communist east is inevitable. The newborn Federal Republic of Germany finds herself in an unenviable position indeed."
 DDR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under Soviet Military governorship, the people of East Germany find themselves under the rule of the very people they oppressed. The occupation has been harsh and morale is low, but there is a glimmer of hope as the military occupation starts its transition toward the planned German Democratic Republic. At last, the home of Marx shall have a government befitting communism's birthplace."
 KPA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shortly following the declaration of the Republic of Korea, the Soviet Union established the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on their side of the 38th parallel. Under former resistance fighter Kim Il-Sung, the DPRK seems poised to pay the iron price to solve the issue of unification. War is coming, and the Korean revolution faces its greatest challenge yet."
 PRC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Japanese have been defeated and the ceasefire with the Kuomintang has broken. The People's Liberation Army has grown exponentially and with the equipment left behind by the Japanese, the Chinese Communists are prepared the secure the rest of China. Despite minimal assistance from the Soviet Union, the leadership of Mao Zedong following the Great March has allowed revolution to flourish. Just a few more key cities, and China shall finally be united!"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Soviet people sacrificed everything in the Great Patriotic War, but in the end it was worth the blood. Hitler was defeated, the Union saved, and under the unwavering hand of Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Union has become a superpower to rival the United States. The war against fascism is over, but the long struggle against imperialism is just starting. Will communism prevail, or will the revolution perish forever?"
 POL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the aftermath of the Second World War, Poland has fell firmly within the Soviet grasp. Boleslaw Bierut, considered a close ally and ideological student of Stalin, stands as the undisputed leader of Poland. The Polish state has a long road ahead of it, but if it can avoid the ire of its people and build their faith in socialism, perhaps the horrors of the Second World War can be left in the past."
 CZE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Left under Soviet supervision in the aftermath of the war, the Czechoslovak Communist Party asserted its total control over the country in 1948 in a Soviet-backed coup d'état. Though firmly a one-party state under communist rule, Czechoslovakia faces growing pressure from Moscow to purge percieved disloyal elements. Sacrifices will have to be made for the revolution in the coming years."
 BUL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Bulgaria fought for the Axis in the Second World War, but when the tides turned against Hitler, the communist-led Fatherland Front overthrew the pro-fascist government and signed peace with the USSR. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished, and since then former Komintern chief and close friend of Stalin, Georgi Dimitrov has led socialist Bulgaria. It seems that for now, Sofia and Moscow are inseparable."
 ROM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Romania fought side by side with Hitler in Operation Barbarossa, where perhaps prophetically the Romanian army was destroyed at Stalingrad. The city's namesake enforced communist rule in Romania not long after, with the monarchy abolished in favor of a Soviet-style workers republic. The Party now faces a split between the Soviet-backed \"prison faction\" and the more moderate \"Moscow faction\" led by Ana Pauker."
 ALB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the 29th of November, 1944, the Albanian Liberation Front under Enver Hoxha liberated all of Albania from Axis occupation. The feeble monarchy was left in the dust, and the People's Republic of Albania declared. Enver Hoxha is a staunch ally of Stalin and Mao, and loyal to the revolution to a fault. Were things to change in Moscow or Beijing, Tirana may not be willing to follow."
 PDG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For the past three years, Greek has fought Greek in a terrible civil war at the behest of the western imperialists. The Greek people are entitled to decide their own destiny, and for the Communist Party of Greece, socialism is that destiny. For now, the momentum is in the hands of the West's puppet king, but can the revolution will prevail in the end?"
 HUN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For a few short years after the end of the Great War, Hungary was one of the first communist states in the world. Unable to link with her Bolshevik allies, the Hungarian revolution was extinguished. Twenty-five years later, the revolution triumphantly returned under the banners of the Soviet Army, putting Budapest firmly in the Soviet sphere. Will Moscow's line hold or is change inevitable?"
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "America's victory in the Second World War cemented its superpower status. Rather than return to isolationism, the United States has moblilized against the Soviet Union in defense of liberty's cause worldwide and anti-communist sentiments run rampant throughout the country. But now that nukes are on the table for both sides, could the United States truly survive against such a formidable foe?"
 ISR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Jewish people were nearly annihilated by Hitler's legions, and yet with Israel's newfound independence, they stand triumphant. For the first time in two thousand years, the Holy Land belongs to the Hebrews. Yet not all is well for the new nation. Her freedom was won through war with all her neighbors, and many political questions must be answered before the Arab states return for revenge."
 YUG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia liberated itself from Nazi occupation under the leadership of Marshal Tito, and since then has maintained fierce independence from both East and West. So far, Tito's \"market socialism\" and \"self-management\" has led to economic recovery, but Yugoslavia's path is by no means clear. Stalin still has ambitions to bring Belgrade back into the fold, and internal divisions could prove dangerous in the future. Can Yugoslavia survive?"
 MON_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under the firm hand of Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Mongolia is on its way to modernization. Thanks to its close relationship with the Soviet Union, Mongolia engaged in its own program of industrialization as the nation emerged from its medieval isolation. Having recently achieved his dream of international recognition, Choibalsan seems poised to rule the steppes for many years to come."
 SIK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The East Turkestan Republic is a conundrum. Formally recognized by the world as a part of China, the civil war has left a power vacuum, and the local Uighurs have taken power under Soviet guidance. With the victory of Mao's communists likely, will Moscow stand by their erstwhile allies, or is East Turkestan doomed to be a footnote in history?"
 IRQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Iraq stands in a position to do much in the Middle East despite its loss in that war, yet it faces a problem with Kurd rebels, most recently inspired by Mustafa Barzani's revolt. Iraq depends upon the British which have access to their oil through the Iraqi Petroleum Company in exchange for aid. At the Hashemite court, there is great conflict between the new "free" military officers and the conservative monarchists that must be resolved."
 EGY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Egypt formally gained its independence from Britain in 1922, but few Egyptians actually believe it. Britain retains its hold on the Suez Canal and dominates the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, while a small aristocracy hold nearly all the wealth and power in the country. Though King Farouk has his fair share of supporters, many powerful figures see him as an effete playboy who is leading the nation to ruin. Only one side will prevail."
 SYR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Syrian Republic's road to independence was a path marred with troubles, and fares no differently today. Along with the failure to thwart the formation of Israel, the government of Shukri al-Quwatli was overthrown in a US-backed military coup. Although General Husni al-Zaim sits in the throne comfortably, other Generals look for their turn to usurp leadership. When Syria can break the chains of dictatorships, can it achieve greatness?"
 JAP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Japan's imperial ambitions met their end with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Now under American occupation, the former Empire of Japan faces an uneasy future and a long road to reconstruction. Under the watchful eye of Douglas MacArthur, the \"Gaijin Shogun,\" constitutional government has returned to Japan. Whether it stays that way remains to be seen."
 PHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Philippines recieved their independence from the United States only a few years ago, and maintains a close alliance with its former overlord in the face of the increasing communist threat at home and abroad. The young nation is unstable, with communist guerrillas and political intrigue threatening to set the islands ablaze. The Philippines are at a crossroads, and the coming years will decide her future for decades to come."
 SIA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Thailand emerged from World War II nearly unscathed. Despite Thai support for Japan, America recognized the regime of Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram after the war due to his staunch anti-communism on the condition that free elections were held, which Phibun won handily. Thailand seems poised to continue its rapid westernization under the Marshal's guidance, but the threat of both the reds and reactionaries remain."
 CUB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Under president Ramón Grau, Cuba abolished the Platt Amendment in 1934 and for the first time in its history, Cuba stood as a truly independent state. In the years since, Cuba has maintained close ties with the United States, and American investments have flown into her ports, even if foreign businessmen and the local elites get most of the spoils. On the home front, Cuban democracy remains a shaky affair indeed."
 DOM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dominican Republic has been under the iron fist of Generalissimo Rafael Trujillo since 1930. The people chafe under his tyranny, but all who have tried to oppose him have met terrible deaths at the hands of the the secret police, commanded by his doggishly loyal lieutenant, Johnny Abbes García. It seems that for now, there is no hope for the Dominican people. But for how long can you keep a people down?"
 BEL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Having been invaded, occupied, and liberated for the second time in the 20th century, Belgium is in a particularly tough time after World War II. Its industry and economy are ruined, military extremely small, and colonial affairs stable but shaky at best. Politically speaking, Belgium is a democracy, but the King holds great power in the minds of the people, as well as rumblings from the Belgian Communists."
 RAJ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After centuries of foreign oppression, the newly proclaimed Dominion of India has finally earned its freedom from Britain. The people celebrate their newfound liberty as India prepares to cut its last ties to London, but the challenges have only just begun for the new state. The Partition caused the deaths and displacement of millions, poverty is rampant, and India faces renewed conflict with its Muslim neighbors in Pakistan over Kashmir."
 KEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is not a model colony, to say the least. Dominated by a tiny minority of white settlers, Kenya is isolated, rural, and impoverished. The natives, especially the Kikuyu tribe, seem poised to revolt, and the colonial administration must do its best to appease the population and find loyalists among the natives before any hopes at keeping order are quickly lost."
 UGA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Uganda maintains a more-hands off administration compared to other British colonies, allowing the traditional kingdoms to maintain their mandates over the tribes. However, the economy remains firmly in the hands of White and Asian settlers, who have excluded native Africans from the profitable cotton industries. This policy, among others, has caused unrest from the Baganda people. Perhaps independence for Uganda is inevitable?"
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Ethiopian Empire is a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse nation of 18 million. Under the charismatic rule of Haile Selassie I, Ethiopia regained her independence from Fascist Italy and has since pursued a staunchly anti-communist foreign policy. As one of the few independent states in Africa, Ethiopia now must tread carefully and be an example for future African nations to follow."
 VIE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Guided by the French, the State of Vietnam stands in opposition to the communist Viet Minh. Despite his efforts to modernize the nation, the emperor, Bao Dai is deeply unpopular and seen as a corrupt puppet of Paris. Change is coming to Vietnam. Will it be under the Viet Minh, or will the State of Vietnam have a revolution of its own?"
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "South Africa fought hard for victory in the war under the leadership of Jan Smuts, a veteran of three wars. However, internal political struggles among the politically marginalized and impoverished Afrikaners led to the victory of the Boer-dominated National Party in 1948. Deeply nationalist, the National Party seems poised to distance itself from Britain and institute its plans for Apartheid, the complete segregation of society."
 NGA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nigeria is an oddity among the British colonies. While most of West Africa remains firmly in the hands of British administrators, Nigeria remains split between numerous tribes and a general division of a Muslim north and Christian south, necessitating a more hands-off approach. As tensions mount between the numerous tribes and feudal lords, tough decisions must be made for the sake of the colony's future."
 OTHER_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Second World War, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
 KEN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Colony and Protectorate of Kenya is not the model colony to say the very least. While most residents of the mainland UK may hardly ever think of this nation of their empire with its 6 million people living in a collection of four major cities and mostly minor towns, the African majority of Kenya thinks of their British subject status regularly. Established at the climax of the scramble for Africa, Kenya as a colony is mainly populated by the ethnic Kikuyu people with a notable level of local British business and settlement. Like in every African colony, there is a small minority of anti-colonial and pan-Africanist student youth and intelligentsia in Kenya mainly organized around the activist Jomo Kenyatta. However, the largely illiterate rural people of the country are the real threat to colonial stability in Kenya as traveling prophets and mystics form militias in the countryside of the central highlands."
 ETH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mother Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Empire is a multi-ethnic and religiously diverse nation home to about 18 million people. Ethiopia is plagued by drought and famine with most of its citizens being illiterate serfs who only speak their regional language, if the crown wishes to modernize its country as it intends to, it will need to address these major issues. As the reconstruction of Ethiopia following the Second Italo-Ethiopian War comes to completion, the Ethiopian Empire appears to be at the height of its stability. As the only relevant independent African nation, Ethiopia has many opportunities available to them in this time lacking internal conflict. With the internationalist foreign policy of Haile Selassie, Ethiopia will likely find itself branching out to the world even farther in this new era defined by superpower rivalry."
 VIE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Guided by the French, State of Vietnam is opposite of the communist Viet Minh. Only time will tell who shall prevail."
 SAF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "South Africa emerged from the Allied victory with its prestige and national honor enhanced as it had fought tirelessly for the Western Allies. South Africa's standing in the international community was rising, at a time when the Third World's struggle against colonialism had still not taken center stage. Just as he did in 1919, Smuts urged the delegates to create a powerful international body to preserve peace; he was determined that, unlike the League of Nations, the United Nations would have teeth. However, internal political struggles in the disgruntled and essentially impoverished Afrikaner community would soon come to the fore leading to Smuts' defeat at the polls in the 1948 elections at the hands of a resurgent National Party after the war. Now, the National Party is on its way to build institutionalized segregation in the country with its Apartheid system."
 POR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After staying neutral in the devastating Second World War, Portugal decided to take a major pro-Western stance by being one of the founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. With widespread communist movements, Portugal must either fight back or risk being the next victim of communism. \n\nThe Estado Novo dictatorship still stands, attempting to maintain its colonial empire. However, a wave flows across Africa, calling for Europe to decolonize. With decolonization already beginning, many are starting to look towards Portugal too, urging them to follow suit. Portugal must either affirm its presence in Africa or consider a different approach.."
 DECADE_CRISIS_NAME:0 "The Decade of Crisis"
 DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The process of decolonization has seen nations achieve freedom peacefully or through violence in Asia. Now, African peoples agitate for freedom with greater fervor as the imperial powers face the growing wave of decolonization. In the Middle East, Arab Nationalism promises to bring glory and destroy the old order. The United States and Soviet Union's rivalry has become an all-out struggle for global influence. Some states are increasingly disenchanted of both Soviet and American machinations. They wish to lead their own destinies and it remains to be seen if these states can survive in this bipolar world order."
 ETH_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Ethiopia faces a crisis of modernity. Trying to prove its relevance, Haile Selassie has focused on foreign policy as pan-Africanism and decolonization take the African continent by storm while neglecting his domestic situation. Outside the imperial capital, Ethiopia is a nation stuck in the Dark Ages and not all are content with the Emperor's ambitions while his people remain poor and illiterate. The Lion of Judah must tread a new path, or it will be slain in the coming battles."
 KEN_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Though the Mau Mau uprising is over, Kenya's troubles know no end. While many see the decolonization of the British Empire as inevitable, a strong, very vocal, group of British settlers and businessmen in the colonial assembly think otherwise. The people cry out for freedom, viewing the imprisoned Jomo Kenyatta as their real leader. Perhaps decolonization is not inevitable, but a reckoning is."
 OILCRISIS_NAME:0 "The Oil Crisis"
 OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "Detenté has seen relations between the United States and Soviet Union go from hostile to at least somewhat understanding. While atomic war might be on hold for now, the world is anything but stable. Vietnam has turned into a disaster for America, the Middle East seems poised to burn, and the non-aligned movement grows in power as more and more nations in the post-colonial world grow tired of the games of West and East. The 1970s will be the most unpredictable decade of the Cold War yet."
 USA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The United States of America has accepted its position as "Leader of the Free World". After Cuba and China fell completely into communism, the "containment strategy" has come into full force. The United States will do anything in its power to stop the spread of communism as Asia, Latin America, and Africa become new battlegrounds for Washington and Moscow. Khrushchev treatens to bury America, but it takes more than empty words to dissuade the American people."
 SOV_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has de-Stalinized their politics and stabilized their internal problems. Now focusing on exploring space and spreading their influence across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The Soviet Union is rising. Will the economic growth and political dominance of the USSR continue or can the Americans turn the tables on the Reds?"
 DDR_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The German Democratic Republic under Walter Ulbricht has continued to follow the Soviet Union on matters of politics and economics. The issue of Republikflucht, the defection of often educated people to West Germany, has proven a critical issue that threatens the nation with a "brain drain". Drastic measures must be taken to preserve the socialist system."
 PRC_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The People's Republic of China emerged victorious from the Chinese civil war. With the Kuomintang banished to Taiwan, Mao has sought to transform China into the most ambitious experiment in socialism yet. Though some successes were achieved, Mao's first decade in power saw the disastrous Great Leap Forward kill millions. Now sidelined from direct leadership of the CCP, the Great Helmsman plots to chart the Chinese revolution back to his radical vision."
 CUB_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Cuba has embraced revolution under the charismatic Fidel Castro. Unrest and instability led to Batista's ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established a one-party socialist state. While the US first reacted favorably to the Cuban revolution, Castro's nationalization of American assets and political exeuctions that followed cooled relations very quickly. Cuba's revolution will soon face its baptism by fire."
 VIE_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed on 26 October 1955, with Ngo Dinh Diem as its first president. Opposed to Ho Chi Minh's government in Hanoi, Diem has embarked on an ambitious program of reform meant to transform Vietnam into his own ideologically unique and often incoherent vision. Failed attempts at reunification, corruption, and political and religious turmoil have left the US and the Vietnamese Army increasingly distrustful of Diem. Another mistake just might set Vietnam aflame."
 FRA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The French Republic has just reformed under Charles de Gaulle into the Fifth Republic, which emerged from the collapse of the Fourth Republic, replacing the former parliamentary republic with a semi-presidential system. De Gaulle, who was the first French President elected under the Fifth Republic in December 1958, believes in a strong head of state, which he describes as embodying l'esprit de la nation -- "the spirit of the nation". Though the country stands behind him, the Algerian War and tensions with Washington must be dealt with sooner than later."
 ENG_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "The United Kingdom has faced defeat after defeat. The Suez Crisis, colonial tensions, and a general decline in its relevancy in the face of American dominance of the capitalist world has left many Britons wondering if the Commonwealth can survive. One thing is for sure. The days when Her Royal Majesty ruled an empire where the sun never sets are fast approaching their end, redefining London's relationships with the Commonwealth and NATO."
 ZIM_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Since 1953, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have comprised an unstable federation. Now, with the new decade, many are wondering if the colonial federation can hold. Anti-colonial agitation and increasing distrust of London in Southern Rhodesia might earn the federation an early grave and an uncertain future for its successors."
 NGA_DECADE_CRISIS_DESC:0 "Thanks to a concerted effort by the political groups of the country, Nigeria is just nearing its planned independence in October. Native politicians have finally been able to form a government. Abubakar Tafawa Balewa will be the Nation's first Prime Minister, facing the task of leading a newborn nation into an uncertain future in the face of ethno-religious conflicts and Cold War machinations."
 1990_DESC:0 "The Cold War is over. America has secured its place as the sole superpower as the Soviet Union seems doomed to collapse, or at least lose its international relevancy. Many nations in the Eastern Bloc are holding free elections for the first time in decades in the wake of the fall of the Berlin Wall. Is this the end of history, or are new conflicts bound to set the world on fire once more?"
 1945_DESC:0 "The most devastating war in the history of mankind is finally over. Germany & Austria are occupied by the UK, the USA, France and the Soviet Union, while Asia erupts into chaos following the surrender of Japan. Fascism is finally defeated, but communism is now rising."
 YUG_1990_DESC:0 "Yugoslavia is falling apart. Since Tito's death, ethnic tensions have been rising across the nation. Now, with the start of a new decade, these tensions might escalate into violence. Can Yugoslavia be saved, or are the Southern Slavs doomed to a terrible fate?"

 USA_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "The USA faces an uncertain future as the last troops prepare to withdraw from Vietnam. Inflation has shot up to nearly nine percent, hurting the power of the American dollar. The youth protest on the streets for peace, justice, and sometimes just for the hell of it. Social changes are coming too, as \"sexual revolution\", \"Black Panther\", and \"feminism\" enter the mainstream parlance. Though Detenté has warmed relations with both Moscow and Beijing, America's cultural reckoning has only just begun."
 PRC_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "The PRC is in the midst of the Cultural Revolution and immense change. Socialist education continues abreast, with young, urban Chinese workers being sent to the countryside for re-education. Chairman Mao remains in power but there is already discussion of who can possibly succeed the father of socialism in China. Tensions with the Soviets remain high as both socialist giants pursue their visions of a socialist society. Hostility remains with the Republic of China, with both states continuing to engage each other diplomatically and through proxy conflicts. Many see the recent breakthrough in relations with the United States as an opportunity to counter the Soviet threat and potentially isolate the ROC."
 SOV_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "Since Khrushchev's ouster in 1964, the Soviet Union has been ruled by the more conservative Leonid Brezhnev. Overseeing increases in living standards and new peace efforts with the United States, the Soviet Union still faces political intrigue at home and a struggle for leadership of the global communist movement against China. Though for now the Soviet Union seems unbreakable, the status quo might not cut it forever."
 EGY_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "Egypt's inconclusive end to the Yom Kippur war has left it in an uncertain position. President Anwar Sadat has for much of his presidency tried to move away from Nasserism, and it was Nasserist thought that led to the disastrous Six Day War in the first place. Perhaps peace with Israel might bring back the Sinai, but such a move would isolate Egypt from its allies in Syria and Libya and put the pan-Arabist movement in the grave."
 ISR_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "While Israeli soldiers prayed on their holiest day, the Egyptians and Syrians sent their armies to war. In two weeks and five days, the enemy was driven back. The marked aggression of the Arab states, combined with Israel's victory, has soldified support from the West. Yet the war is now over, and Israel must tread the long road to peace with the Arab nations if the Jewish people are to make something of their sacrifice."
 FRA_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "France's days as a great power are coming to an end. The Empire is but a distant memory. The American domination of the west is an insult to French sentiments as well. If France cannot be an imperialist power anymore, then she must preserve her culture, her pride, and her dignity in the tumultuous years to come so that the French people will always have a place in the world."
 SYR_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "Syria's humiliating defeat in the catastrophic Six-Day War, culminating in the seizure of the Golan Heights by the Zionist foe led to the falling out of Salah Jadid. After the inevitable power struggle, President Hafez al-Assad stood on top to implement his Corrective Movement, an ambitious program of modernization. Syria will be reborn, and the Lion of the Levant will have his revenge against the Israelis and their Western friends."

 ETH_OILCRISIS_DESC:0 "While it has taken the Ethiopian student youth and intelligentsia several decades longer to plant themselves firmly in specific international ideologies, these movements were always inevitable in their fruition due to the sturdy, unchanging status quo of the Imperial Monarchy. The last decade saw the first forming of Marxist and Agrarian Socialist parties in the country along with an attempted reformist coup against the monarchy; which though inscrutable from the outside, still maintains far flung consequence in the ethos of the carefully conspiring generals and young officers of the nation. No, the question is not will the Ethiopian Empire devolve into revolution, it is a matter of when - regardless of any reformative measures the Lion of Judah can take."

 SUEZCRISIS_DESC:0 "The world is once again close to a total war. As Gamal Abdel Nasser has nationalized the Suez canal, some nations are seeing this as a conflict of interest. The British and the French see it as a threat to their empires. However, Israel might also get on board with the plan given their tensions with the Arab states. The question is, What happens next?"
 ARG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the end of the Infamous Decade, the approval of women's suffrage, and the election of Perón, Argentina seems to be on course to democracy. Perón is midway through his presidency, and already it seems that he will transform the Argentine economy and its people and cement his political legacy for decades to come."
 VIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Vietnam has been abandoned by the French. All attempts at independence have failed. Bao Dai, the Japanese collaborator, is the enemy of the Viet Minh once more. The blood spilled in the razing of Hanoi by Chinese imperialists will be repaid in French blood. Vietnam's struggle is now one against Western imperialism, and Ho Chi Minh now looks towards communism to win his battles."
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "France is heavily split. From the Renault Strike in 1947 to the bread riots of Le Mans and Verdun and the occupation of communist newspapers, the country is ready to fall into chaos. It must also face rebellions in Madagascar and Indochina, all while ensuring that the Métropole does not fall into rebellion as well. Rationing and strikes have characterized France thus far, but it is impossible to endure such privation forever. Will France and her empire endure or fall?"
 SPR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Second World War was traumatic to Spain. Francisco Franco watched as his fellow fascists fell in battle against the Allies. The Falange still controls the Spanish population, and with the beginning of the Cold War, it is unlikely if anything in Spain will change. Authoritarianism has kept Spain stable yet isolated, and few want change, but there is always the chance of change."
 GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Greece lies in the crosshairs of East and West alike. The machinations of the foreign powers have left Greece, already weakened by the scars of the Nazi occupation, to barrel into what has become a three year long civil war. With her very existence threatened by the Soviet-backed communist rebels, the Kingdom must rally the people and bring peace to the nation before it is too late."
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For eight long years, the Chinese people fought tooth and nail to expel the Japanese imperialists. Now our nation is threatened once more. The Soviet-backed Communists under the traitorous Mao Zedong broke the United Front and have taken large swathes of the country. The situation is dire, and already the red bandits lay siege to Shanghai. The coming months shall decide whether all Dr. Sun fought for will endure."
 ITA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The feverish pitch after the death of Mussolini has subsided. The abolition of the monarchy in 1948 has given the Italian Republic a spirit of hope and freedom, but many questions remain unanswered about her future. Italy is politically divided, with the communists and fascist remnants alike threatening her young democracy. Italy's future is uncertain, but sure to be chaotic."
 PER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Iran suffered from Anglo-Soviet occupation for five years. The Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, became the British-endorsed replacement for his father. The mild Shah would do little in his first years in power, leading to the creation of a loose democratic body. The prime minister now holds considerable power, with the Shah sidelined from politics. As Iran enters the Cold War, will it do so under the vision of the Majlis, the Shah, or new forces entirely?"
 FIN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Finland's independence and international position since the end of World War II have been described as unique and baffling. The harsh Treaty of Paris left Finland in the Soviet sphere, forced to give up territory and lease ports to the Red Navy. Despite this extreme Soviet pressure, Finland has maintained a democratic government. Finland must tread the coming years carefully, and decide whether Moscow's threats or its democratic values matter more."
 NIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nicaragua is a nation with a rich and troubled history. Under the Somoza dictatorship, Nicaragua faces US meddling, social strife, and guerrilla warfare. The opposition to Somoza, inspired by the anti-imperialist hero Sandino, fight for social justice and national sovereignty. Nicauragua is caught between two worlds, and the rising flames are unavoidable."
 CAM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the end of the World War, Cambodia has gained a measure of autonomy from her French masters. As the nation takes its first steps toward independence, the future remains uncertain. Will the people rally around the young king, or choose their own path as colonialism begins to crumble?"
 MOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Morocco is a protectorate kept on a short leash by the French. Under the charismatic king, Mohammed V, the people of Morocco have taken their first steps toward independence, at the cost of increasing anger from Paris. The nation stands at a crossroads, and as tensions rise between the King and his French masters, can Morocco ever hope to secure her long-desired freedom?"
 SAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia would have been unrecognizable only twenty years ago. The unification of the Arabian kingdoms under the banner of the House of Saud and the subsequent discovery of oil by American prospectors in 1933 has brought the desert kingdom unprecedented prosperity. King Abdulaziz has ruled wisely, spending his oil profits on the development of the nation, but he grows older by the day. Will his successors maintain his wisdom?"
 ZIM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Colony of Southern Rhodesia enjoys the privilege of self-government, of course limited to the white minority. Recently, talks of forming a federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have started to gain steam, and it seems only a matter of time before Parliament allows negotiations to begin."
 GHA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The resource-rich Colony of the Gold Coast played an important role in supplying Britain during the war, and has gained some measure of autonomy as a result. With a byzantine, decentralized administration and increasing agitation from the native population, the Gold Coast must tread carefully in the coming years."
 MLA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the early 19th century, the Malayan peninsula has been under the complete domination of Great Britain and the feudal lords who pay their tribute to London. While Britain has promised independence and reform, the communists under Chin Peng have decided to take action now rather than later, and the power of their insurgency grows with each passing day. Will the revolution prevail?"
 AFG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Afghanistan, the Graveyard of Empires, remained out of the Second World War. The quiet mountain kingdom has remained stuck in time for centuries, but in recent years has transitioned to a constitutional monarchy and began a campaign of modernization. Yet in a nation where the tribes are as many as the mountains, not all agree with the King and his ministry. The Barakzai dynasty faces a great challenge indeed."
 QAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The little Kingdom of Qatar is a British protectorate. Isolated and backwards, Qatar has seen new hope with the discovery of oil a decade ago. With the profits largely going to London, perhaps it is time the Qataris choose their own destiny, whether under the Al-Thani dynasty or otherwise."
 SWE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sweden remained neutral as the world was set ablaze by war, and remains neutral still. The division of the world between West and East complicates this matter. However much Sweden would like to focus on internal development, the Swedish people must choose between realizing the dream of \"Folkhemmet\" or preparing the nation for the possibility of a war even worse than the last."
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For hundreds of years, the Turks ruled over the mighty Ottoman Empire, but in the aftermath of its collapse in the Great War, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk declared a new Turkish republic, firmly secular, nationalist, and committed to democratic and western values. Turkey has remained true to Kemalism in the years since his death, but pressure from both the Western Allies and the Soviet Union is rising. Soon, Turkey must pick a side, or be left in the dust."
 BRM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Burma regained its independence after the Second World War, but her first years of freedom have been challenging to say the least. Ethnic separatists and communist rebels threaten to set the fragile government in Rangoon ablaze. Whether Burma itself will survive, let alone the government, remains to be seen."
 BCP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Red Flag Communist Party, led by the red general Thakin Than Tun, was one of the leaders of the resistance against Japanese occupation. With Burma now independent, Tan Tun's communists have taken up arms against the central government, who they see as not sufficiently socialist. Were they to succeed, Burma would fall firmly within the Communist Bloc."
 LEB_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Lebanon became independent in 1943, but its woes have not ended since. \"Greater Lebanon\" was a ultimately creation of French colonialists, and the nation lies divided between Sunnis, Shias, Maronites, Armenians, and a myriad other religious and racial groups all vying for domination of the small and fragile country. To avoid civil war and save Lebanese democracy would take a miracle."
 YEM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "On the shores of the Red Sea, the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen is stuck in the medieval era. The tyrannical and unpredictable rule of King Ahmad bin Yahya has made few friends and many enemies, among them his British masters who cannot stand his constant claims to the Aden protectorate and his dreams of \"Greater Yemen\"."
 LBA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the end of Italian rule over Libya, Idris I as-Senussi has ruled the Emirate of Cyrenaica with a steady hand and an ambition to unite all of Libya under his rule, a proposition not shared by France and Britain. Only recently liberated from colonialism, Cyrenaica now faces the threat of colonialism once more from its supposed allies, and the Emir's dream of a united Libya could very well slip away."
 BHR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Bahrain is barely noticeable on a map, but the discovery of oil in 1929 and its strategic importance on the Persian Gulf have made it all too important for its British masters. While Bahrain might prefer independence, the age-old and still very active Iranian claim to its territory means that its relationship to Britain is a necessary evil. Until Iran abandons such notions, the status quo will remain."
 PAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When British rule over India ended in 1947, the old Raj was divided into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan. The resulting killed thousands and displaced millions more, but in the end the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent now have a nation to call their own. The new nation, like its Indian rival, suffers from poverty, division, and an uncertain future as the world splits in two."
 JOR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Jordan left the 1948 Arab-Israeli war beaten, but not defeated. The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan now stands as an independent state, and is committed to maintaining its newfound freedom. The question of how to approach Israel remains. King Abdullah is open to formal peace talks, while many among the people and especially the Palestinians in the Jordanian-administered West Bank have no desire for compromise."
