#Cuban Exiles Land in Bay of Pigs! (News)
#Today, the world was shocked to wake up to reports that a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, known as Brigade 2506, have landed in the Bay of Pigs off the southwestern coast of Cuba. A force of about 1,400 men, armed with American equipment as well as B-26 bombers, are engaging with Cuban military and security services, who were quickly alerted to their presence. The United States has denied any responsibility in the invasion, according to a statement by the US Ambassador to the United Nations. The Soviets, predictably, have decried the invasion as a “CIA plot using paid criminals”, much to the chagrin of the United States. 
#Cuban Exiles Land at Trinidad! (News)
#Today, the world was shocked to wake up to reports that a group of anti-Castro Cuban exiles, known as Brigade 2506, have landed in Trinidad, Cuba, approximately 170 miles southwest of the capital, Havana. A force of about 1,400 men, armed with American equipment as well as B-26 bombers, have faced little resistance from Cuban military and security services and are presently contacting local insurgent groups to aid their fight. The United States has denied any involvement in the invasion, according to a statement by the US Ambassador to the United Nations. The Soviets, predictably, have decried the invasion as a “CIA plot using paid criminals”, much to the chagrin of the United States.
#Cuban Exile Invasion a Success!
#The landings of Cuban exile forces only days ago has ended in the complete overthrow of the Castro government in Havana! With the assistance of local insurgents, air support, and US naval presence, the exiles have formed a provisional government, as they round up communist sympathizers and imprison them. The United States has expressed great approval at these developments, declaring that “communism has been vanquished in Cuba” and promising aid for the exiles, who will predictably join the US's sphere of influence. While there are no comments from the Soviets yet, it is clear that they are not pleased with these developments.
#Cuban Exile Invasion a Failure!
#Unfortunately, reports from media outlets in Cuba's capital, Havana, have indicated that a local rebellion of anti-Castro insurgent exiles has been crushed by Cuban military and security forces. From the start, the landing of said exiles (known as Brigade 2506) was a disaster, with Cuban forces being easily tipped off to their landing location, and their support ships being forced to run aground without offloading their supplies. With hundreds killed and the rest captured and marked for execution, the outcome does not look good for the anti-communist movement in Cuba. 
#Should the US Intervene in Cuba?
#With the failure of Brigade 2506 to successfully overthrow the Cuban government immediately, we have to ponder our options. They continue to fight on, but only for a few more days. Our generals have drawn up plans for US intervention in Cuba, including the use of our Atlantic Fleet as well as the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and armored units to quickly subdue the Cuban military and security forces. Some have expressed opposition to this plan, considering that the Soviet Union could respond offensively in kind. However, we must act quickly, and a decision must be made.
#US Intervenes in Cuba (News)
#Shocking news came out of Cuba today as approximately four US Army and Marine divisions landed in Cuba, only days after the ill-fated landing by Cuban exile Brigade 2506. Elements of the 101st Airborne and 82nd Airborne Divisions have landed at Jose Marti and San Antonio de los Banos Airfields, as well as Mariel and Baracoa Airfields surrounding Havana. The 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions, meanwhile, have landed at Tarara, approximately 10 miles from Havana's city center, as the US enforces a naval blockade and air superiority of the island. It is clear that Castro's government will not stand much of a chance unless the Soviets intervene.
#US Does Not Intervene in Cuba (News)
#In an official statement today, the President announced that while the United States nominally supports Brigade 2506's mission, the US will not intervene militarily to overthrow Castro despite the military options provided. Pundits speculate a fear of Soviet aggression as being one of the principal factors, although they assume that US intelligence services will continue to harass Cuba in the coming months.

 #Raid Suspected UIA Compounds
 #Deport Suspect Western Ukranian Villages
 #Establish Fictitious OUN Leadership Cells
 #Apprehend Kiev Oblast OUN Militia Cells
 #Apprehend Vinnytsia Oblast OUN Militia Cells
 #Assassinate Stepan Bandera

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_1:0 "First, we need to coordinate with local MGB Operatives in order to coordinate Roman's arrest, as well as acquiesce their aid in the subsequent cover up."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_1:0 "To ensure the target isn't able to escape the kill zone, we will coordinate with local, internal authorities to ensure his house is surrounded by several hundred soldiers of the interior."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_1:0 "While a firefight is inevitable, we can't allow the OUN to portray Shukhevych as a martyr. We'll make his death look like a suicide, and burn his body at the Zbruch River so it can't be recovered." 

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_2:0 "Our intelligence and security apparatus will immediately do an threat assessment of potential areas for UIA compounds, focusing on the most active cells in the region."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_2:0 "Next, our agents will focus their tactics on pinpointing the locations of any UIA cells, focusing on their leaders and major threats to local government officials and infrastructure."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_2:0 "Finally, the pinnacle of our operation will come when our agents and security forces will, acting on intelligence, raid and liquidate cell members, thus protecting local party members and further eliminating the fascists."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_3:0 "Local party leadership and cadres will discuss with the security apparatus to identify which local villages are the likeliest to support the UIA."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_3:0 "Next, our agents will focus on surveiling villages from the target list and determine which have the highest support for the fascists and have likely provided aid to the fascists in the past."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_3:0 "Finally, the squad along with local people's defense units under their command will surround the village and proceed to deport the population to the Far East."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_4:0 "After locating OUN Cells across the Ukrainian SSR, we will embed them within the organisation, with fake identities, and histories in order to grant ourselves a firm foundation."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_4:0 "Before our agents can assume leadership positions within the OUN, we need to help fast track their career to build their internal status within the Organisation."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_4:0 "Coordinating with our infiltrators, we'll subtly target key members of leadership in each individual cell for subtle assassination, in order to pave the way for the hasty promotions of the agents we've embedded."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_5:0 "While local authorities have struggled with apprehending these militants themselves, they do hold critical information, such as names and locations."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_5:0 "Open combat with local Militias is ill advised, and so long as they remain in contact with their leaders, they are able to coordinate a resistance."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_5:0 "With militants isolated from their command structure, and being unable to coordinate with one another, with the aid of local authorities, they can be apprehended with minimal resistance, or evidence of our involvement."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_6:0 "While local authorities have struggled with apprehending these militants themselves, they do hold critical information, such as names and locations."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_6:0 "Open combat with local Militias is ill advised, and so long as they remain in contact with their leaders, they are able to coordinate a resistance."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_6:0 "With militants isolated from their command structure, and being unable to coordinate with one another, with the aid of local authorities, they can be apprehended with minimal resistance, or evidence of our involvement."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_UIA_7:0 "Due to the fact Bandera is located in Munich, ensuring our agents remain both unnoticed, and efficient is crucial.  Ensuring a lack of witness's is crucial to the operations success."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_UIA_7:0 "Once ordered, the agents will surround the collaborator, and spray them with a Cyanide spray gun, a lethal, but most importantly quite execution."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_UIA_7:0 "Once the execution succeeds, smuggling our agents back across the border is of high priority, as to ensure the death of Bandera can't be tied back to the Soviet Union, and to avoid the arrest of any of our agents."

 UIA_1_Success_desc:0 "[GetCurrentSquadTitle]'s operation to assassinate Roman Shukhevych has resulted in a resounding success, as his death was made to look like a suicide while resisting civil arrest."
 UIA_1_Failure_desc:0 "The attempted assassination of Roman Shukhevych by [GetCurrentSquadTitle] ended in unfortunate failure, as he managed to evade [GetCurrentSquadTitle], and escape to an as of now, unknown location."
 UIA_2_Success_desc:0 "A counterinsurgency operation by [GetCurrentSquadTitle] on suspected Ukrainian Insurgent Army locations has succeeded, resulting in multiple arrest, and a seizure of arms."
 UIA_2_Failure_desc:0 "An attempted raid on Ukrainian Insurgent Army compounds, lead by [GetCurrentSquadTitle] ended not only in failure, but the deaths of multiple of our agents."
 UIA_3_Success_desc:0 "[GetCurrentSquadTitle] has succeeded in locating, and deporting countless suspected insurgents, and insurgency sympathisers, across the western Ukraine, resulting in a sharp decline of Insurgency activity in the region."
 UIA_3_Failure_desc:0 "he attempts of [GetCurrentSquadTitle] to cripple Insurgent aligned villages in the western Ukraine has not only ended in failure, but further galvanised the insurgencies support base in the region."
 UIA_4_Success_desc:0 "The attempts of [GetCurrentSquadTitle]'s to infiltrate the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists has ended in success, and the establishment of multiple of our undercover plants rising to leadership positions in the organisation."
 UIA_4_Failure_desc:0 "The infiltration attempts of [GetCurrentSquadTitle] were not only uncovered, but resulted in the expulsion, and execution of multiple of our plants within the organisation."
 UIA_5_Success_desc:0 "The efforts of [GetCurrentSquadTitle] to arrest, and suppress Nationalist militias in the Kiev Oblast has succeeded, and dealt a sizeable blow to the armed presence of  the OUN in the capital of the Ukrainian SSR."
 UIA_5_Failure_desc:0 "he failure of [GetCurrentSquadTitle] to apprehend Nationalist militias in the Kiev Oblast has ended in the death of multiple agents, and seems to have only strengthened the OUN's presence within the Oblast."
 UIA_6_Success_desc:0 "The efforts of [GetCurrentSquadTitle] to arrest, and suppress Nationalist militias in the Vinnytsia Oblast has succeeded, and dealt a sizeable blow to the armed presence of  the OUN in the Region."
 UIA_6_Failure_desc:0 "The failure of [GetCurrentSquadTitle] to apprehend Nationalist militias in the Vinnytsia Oblast has ended in the death of multiple agents, and seems to have only strengthened the OUN's presence within the Oblast."
 UIA_7_Success_desc:0 "The assassination of the once prolific Nazi collaborator by [GetCurrentSquadTitle] (unless you want to use the historical name of the one who assassinated him, being Bohdan Stashynsky) has resulted in resounding success, as Bandera collapsed outside his Munich apartment, due to a Cyanide gas poisoning."
 UIA_7_Failure_desc:0 "Stepan Bandera has unfortunately evaded assassination once more, as [GetCurrentSquadTitle]'s attempt to assassinate the collaborator with Cyanide gas failed, as Bandera managed to evacuate the premises before the gas could take effect."

 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_1:0 "After meeting with local contacts, our agents were able to properly vet the local recruitment candidates. The local candidates proved politically reliable and passed our basic background checks. While training in regard to strategy and weapon usage will be needed, the new recruits should aid in our future endeavors."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_2:0 "Our agents successfully managed to expand the local arms caches without drawing undue attention, especially from communist agents and law enforcement. Trusted local collaborators were informed about the expansion and how to access the weaponry in case of an emergency before the squad returned to a CIA black site for exfiltration."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_3:0 "After establishing contact with regional leadership, the squad was able to quickly improve strategies for inflicting the maximum amount of harm upon the Soviet occupiers and disrupting the Soviet supply chain throughout the nation. In the days after departure, the local network successfully launched their anti-Soviet resistance campaign."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_4:0 "Our confidential sources within the military have confirmed that the assassination was a success! The security forces are scrambling, but our agents were able to escape comfortably to our black site."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_5:0 "Our confidential sources within the military have confirmed that the assassination was a success! The security forces are scrambling, but our agents were able to escape comfortably to our black site."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_6:0 "Our confidential sources within the intelligence services have confirmed that the assassination was a success! The security forces are scrambling, but our agents were able to escape comfortably to our black site."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_7:0 "Our operatives quickly managed to disguise themselves as members of local militant far-left factions and recruited trusted local operatives to launch a false-flag terrorist attack in the target nation. This has had the desired effect of reducing leftist support in the nation."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_8:0 "Upon deployment, the squad was able to make contact with local far-right elements associated with Operation Gladio and inform them of their role in launching an attack on local far-left elements. The attack was swiftly carried out with support from the squad and managed to inflict damage to leftist party infrastructure."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_9:0 "Our agents were able to swiftly come into contact with local supporters of Operation Gladio who are also members of far-right groups. Utilizing local far-right contacts, the squad managed to evoke a violent response from local leftist supporters leading to an outright riot."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_10:0 "After various negotiations with local business interests and party officials, our operatives have successfully established a money-funding route to launder money through legitimate local business to fund pro-American parties. This will be a major step in promoting political stability."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_11:0 "Our efforts to find palatable candidates to bribe has paid off, leading to further infiltration into the target nation’s government. The squad’s operatives were able to covertly approach various political and bureaucratic officials and convince them of our way of thinking while providing monetary compensation."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_12:0 "The squad covertly approached various low and mid-level intelligence officers in the target nation who were identified as having pro-American sympathies. The intelligence turned out to be accurate and several new connections have been made with the target’s intelligence services."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_13:0 "After a significant amount of time researching and investigating the allotted targets, the squad has accumulated extensive dossiers on the individuals. The dossiers include allegations raising from financial crimes to extramarital affairs as well as homosexual activity."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_14:0 "After a thorough review, the squad has brought in the required information needed by our analysts to formulate a strategy moving forward with the regime project in the target. With this completed, we will need to determine who should be the leader of the coup along with ensuring enough support is gathered for the plot to succeed."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_15:0 "After reviewing several candidates, the list of possible leaders for the target are listed below, whom should we back for taking over the government?"
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_16:0 "The squad was able to quickly instigate various incidents throughout the target nation and wreak havoc, painting the government as weak and ineffective at combating the terrorist threat. Additionally, our friends in the media have further inflamed the situation by accusing the government of complicity in recent events."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_17:0 "After confronting figures in the government we have compromising material on, the targets acquiesced to our demands to back our future efforts in the nation, greatly bolstering our efforts in the ongoing regime change project."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_SUCCESS_18:0 "The squad in conjunction with a plethora of local collaborators, operatives and sympathizers were able to quickly establish a foothold in the capital at the start of the operation. This led to a swift capture of leading government figures and the consolidation of the armed forces behind the new government."

 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_1:0 "Our agents successfully managed to expand the local arms caches without drawing undue attention, especially from communist agents and law enforcement. Trusted local collaborators were informed about the expansion and how to access the weaponry in case of an emergency before the squad returned to a CIA black site for exfiltration."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_2:0 "Unfortunately, our agents were observed leaving the arms cache locations drawing the attention of local law enforcement. While our agents managed to escape from law enforcement, several of our arms caches have been uncovered and seized by the government. On a similar note, further scrutiny on arms caches will certainly make similar efforts difficult."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_3:0 "PLACEHOLDER IGNORE"
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_4:0 "Unfortunately, our assassination attempt on General [?slot_one_personnel_target.GetName] was unsuccessful, as our agents mistakenly killed the general’s aide instead. Some agents were able to escape but several were captured by the security forces."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_5:0 "Unfortunately, our assassination attempt on Admiral [?slot_one_personnel_target.GetName] was unsuccessful, as our agents mistakenly killed the admiral’s aide instead. Some agents were able to escape but several were captured by the security forces."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_6:0 "Unfortunately, our assassination attempt on a noted left-wing activist was unsuccessful, as our agents mistakenly killed an ordinary civilian instead. Some local collaborators were able to escape but several were captured by the security forces."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_7:0 "Upon deployment, the squad was able to make contact with local far-right elements associated with Operation Gladio and inform them of their role in launching an attack on local far-left elements. However, police managed to catch our collaborators immediately before the attack took place leading to the squad beating a hasty retreat."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_8:0 "Unfortunately, while our agents were able to cause significant local chaos, neither side openly came out to engage in violence leading to the operation being a moderate failure. While local far-right elements were encouraged to antagonize leftist supporters, the far-left did not further escalate or engage, preventing a riot from forming."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_9:0 "Unfortunately, while our operatives managed to find reliable information and collaborators in the local area, our collaborators were caught due to related crimes resulting in the operation being a bust. Thankfully, our operatives were largely able to escape mostly unscathed."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_10:0 "At first, our operatives made progress in establishing contacts for the operation. Unfortunately, local law enforcement caught onto the scheme and indicted local business interests that were working for the operation. While we will ensure their swift release if possible, this still represents a failure in the operation."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_11:0 "Initially, our agents were able to identify various political officials who were susceptible to bribery. Unfortunately, our efforts ran into an undercover campaign to uncover corruption in the government leading to a failure in the operation. Fortunately, all agents were able to exfiltrate properly and in a timely manner."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_12:0 "The squad covertly approached various low and mid-level intelligence officers in the target nation who were identified as having pro-American sympathies. Unfortunately, our intelligence was faulty leading to our operatives needing to make a hasty escape from local law enforcement resulting in the failure of the operation."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_13:0 "After a significant amount of time researching and investigating the allotted targets, the squad has failed to materialize any credible blackmail material. Whether this failure is due to an intelligence failure, the ineptness of the squad or the actual targets being relatively clean has yet to be determined."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_14:0 "PLACEHOLDER IGNORE"
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_15:0 "After a thorough review, none of the candidates interviewed were capable of meeting our pre requirements for backing their leadership after a successful coup."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_16:0 "While our forces were able to stage some incidents in the target nation, the public has remained rather apathetic to the situation. To make matters worse, the media, despite our efforts, has not picked up on the story and the government has yet to be damaged by our efforts to deteriorate the political situation."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_17:0 "Unfortunately, after confronting various figures we have compromising material on, the targets largely refused to go along with our demands. This is a major setback for our program and runs the risk of our plans being found out by leading government figures."
 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_FAILURE_18:0 "Unfortunately, the government was tipped off in advance about the imminent coup which led to the failure of the plotters to seize control over the military or detain key members of the government. While the squad managed to exfiltrate mostly intact, various collaborators have been lost and our intelligence strength will surely suffer."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_1:0 "CIA analysts will determine the optimal contacts in the target to recruit from. Once this has been completed, our agents will establish contact with said figures."
 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_2:0 "Before expanding our current arms caches, our agents will first evaluate the status of our current caches throughout the nation to determine how to proceed."
 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_3:0 "In preparation for the national uprising, the squad will contact regional leadership to inform them of their orders and other needed information."

 PHASE_1_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_18:0 "The squad will visit local operation networks and collaborators to ensure support for the operation along with rallying our supporters for the upcoming operation."

 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_1:0 "Our agents will discreetly go to ground in major cities in the nation and then proceed to utilize our contacts among sympathetic forces to contact potential recruits."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_2:0 "After a thorough review, our agents will deploy to the arm cache sites and expand the weaponry stocks in said caches. Trusted local operatives will also be informed of the improvements."

 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_8:0 "After securing local support, the squad will give out weaponry to our collaborators and design a strategy to launch the attack."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_9:0 "Our agents will actively seek to provoke both sides to open fighting by staging lower level fights, vandalism and assaults on both sides while framing each other for the incidents."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_10:0 "To disguise the origin of the funds for the party, our agents will seek local collaborators who own businesses to establish money laundering fronts to funnel money to the party."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_11:0 "Targets determined will be surveilled to ensure targets have no known connections to the far-left and will be unlikely to betray our operations in the long-term."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_12:0 "Utilizing priorly collected information, the squad will determine a list of potential targets to contact within the target’s intelligence services to recruit into the program."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_13:0 "Targets established in the draft list will be thoroughly investigated for any sexual perversity, extra-marital affairs, and other criminal offenses for blackmail material."
 PHASE_2_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_14:0 "Military leaders, pro-American ministers, and local collaborators will be sought out by the squad and interviewed to determine their loyalty in advance of our ongoing plans."

 PHASE_3_Operation_DESC_GLADIO_2:0 "Finally, our agents will seek to cover their tracks by improving the disguises and hidden locations of the caches before covertly exfiltrating and avoiding local law enforcement."
