 ####Legacy Events###   
  
 DDR_Harich.1.d:0 "The aversion against the Stalinist Soviet occupation of East Germany has boiled over and resulted in a takeover by the Harich Group. Germans across the country, outraged at the persecution of the group, have risen up. The court where the Harish Group members were being held has been overrun and the members have been freed. The NKVD camps have been stormed and general strikes have placed the country into a deadlock.\nFrom the chaos, the Harich Group has taken de facto control over the country and promised to bring liberal reforms to the country. Already, Stalinist loyalists have begun to flee the country fearing that they may be killed by the rebellious Harich supporters."
 DDR_Harich.10.d:0 "Desiring the unity and particular autonomy of the German people, the East German government has called for Pan-German elections. Citing that the German people no longer wish to be controlled by foreign powers but rather be free to govern themselves, the East German government has pledged its support for these elections. The East German government has also outlined a series of plans on how these elections will work and properly represent the will of the German people.\nWhile Germans support this proposal fervently, it has drawn internal division within' the 2 sphere who are skeptical that it would be within' their best interests. Both sides have yet to release official statements or positions on the matter."
 ulbricht_purge.1.d:0 "Walter Ulbricht, the First Secretary of the German Democratic Republic, has been executed on the order of Politburo of the Central Committee. Soon after the death of Stalin, massive riots broke out across the country. The pro-Stalinist leaders have failed to contain the riots and they have become a full revolution, deposing the pro-Stalinist government.\nHeinrich Rau, the Chairman of the Economic Commission and Wilhelm Zaisser, the head of Stasi have become the de facto leaders. Immediately after gaining power, both Rau and Zaisser accused Ulbricht to be a traitor to the German people and a puppet installed by the Soviets to manipulate German workers into following a defunct sect of Marxism. Ulbricht was given a very long trial with extensive representation and has been found guilty of conspiring against the German people. Fearing Ulbricht's supporters may attempt to intercept the convoy, Ulbricht was executed immediately behind the courtroom."
 ddr_zaisser_purged.1.d:0 "Wilhelm Zaisser, the Minister of State Security of the German Democratic-Republic has been removed from power on the order of Walter Ulbricht. Following the suppressed Worker's Uprising, Ulbricht has resecured his position and ordered the execution of Rau and several others he has labelled as \"the enemies of the state\".\nThe full list of charges brought against Wilhelm Zaisser include poor standing with the rest of the party, associating with others who have poor standing, being an enemy of the people, and not using enough of the repressive power of the Stasi during the uprising.\nZaisser has been stripped of his position but will continue to work as a translator at the Institute of Marxism and Leninism in East Berlin."
 mielke_purged.1.d:0 "Erich Mielke, the Security Chief of the Economic Commission of the German Democratic-Republic, has been removed from power on the order of Heinrich Rau. Accused of operations against the people, Erich was given a lengthy trial and eventually found guilty but not of all charges. Erich Mielke has been stripped of his position and will be sent to work as a translator in the Institute of Marxism and Leninism in East Berlin.\nThe charges of being an enemy of the people and an corruptor of Marx's teachings have passed but conspiracy and treason charges have not. It was decided that time spent reading and translating Marx's works and the philosophies of true Marxists would aid Erich Mielke to see the true light of socialism. "
 anti_harich_group.1.d:0 "The Harich Group, a circle of like-minded liberal Marxists, have been arrested and put on trial.\nThe group, led by Wolfgang Harich, has long supported the liberalization of society and the overthrow of the illiberal Stalin reforms. The members of the group have desired to bring an end to the Stasi and bring on civil rights reforms in the country.\nAfter extensive investigations and interrogations, most of the group's key members have been arrested and charged for being an enemy of the people. The trial's evidence comprises mostly of public positions held by the members of the group and a vast number of anonymous witnesses to backdoor deals. The members have all been sentenced either to death or will continue to work low-risk jobs under arrest."
 ddr_media.1.d:0 "The Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF), the official state television broadcaster, has just made its debut. For a long time, radio has been the primary broadcast medium in East Germany. However, since the early 50s, television has been growing in popularity. The DFF will bring high-quality entertainment and education to the masses.\nThe programming available is as follows:\nMarxist education for children\nDaily news from the communist sphere\nWeekly reports on the state of affairs\nComedy shows featuring popular figureheads\nVariety Acts\nKnowledge-Based Game Shows\nThe History Program\nAnd more coming soon"
 waldheimer_prozesse.1.d:0 "3442 Nazi war and domestic atrocity criminals are on trial today in Waldheim. These individuals are being charged with a variety of crimes including crimes against humanity, mass murder, war crimes, and many other crimes. The defendants are amongst the last of the Nazi war criminals who have yet to be tried for their crimes. The trials will be carried out in quick succession due to the large numbers of individuals on trial. Several independent reporters are claiming that the trials are not fair and being conducted too quickly with most defendants only getting a few minutes on trial. Most troubling of these reports is a 14 year old boy named Walter Jurisch who has been sentenced to 20 years. One of the prosecutors has responded by stating that they are Nazis and Nazis do not have rights. Another prosecutor has claimed that it is a "grace that the enemies of the People's Republic get a trial at all"."
 FDJ.0.d:0 "The Socialist Union Party of Germany announced initiatives to promote a socialist German identity for its people. Germany, the homeland of Karl Marx is where socialism was first developed. Politically, socialism has long been an important force in the development of the country. For too long outside forces and capitalist interests sought to limit or erase this identity but no more. It will also allow Germany to have its own identity and vision within the socialist world and end any criticism we are a Soviet client or puppet."
 Beat_Music.1.d:0 "As part of a new initiative to provide greater liberalization in the state, the government announced plans to allow and sponsor the popular trend of beat music. Government radio stations will be allowed to play certain songs approved by the relevant ministry. The government will make sure any Western music in the genre is carefully vetted. The state also announced plans to support certain music groups to bring a socialist version of the music. The government is confident its efforts will reduce the troubling trend of young people seeking Western music through dangerous capitalist radio stations."
 Beat_Music.2.d:0 "The recent government effort to manage and control the popular beat music has not gone well. As such, we will now ban beat music. Our youth continue to seek Western songs from hostile radio stations. More troubling, those involved in our sponsored bands are engaging with controversial and dangerous lyrics, no doubt inspired by the capitalists. To prevent unrest or anger from the youths, we have directed government agencies to prepare new music and dance styles for the young people that provides them a creative outlet while maintaining the integrity of the socialist state."
 Beat_Music.3.d:0 "The Socialist Union Party recently launched a Music Talent Competition to inspire the young people. Unfortunately, the show ended rather poorly. Unfortunately, the bands decided to play music that has been clearly banned from the state and lacked a socialist theme. The crowd of young people went wild with the music. Many officials and older members in the audience were greatly offended by the music and demand action. We have directed the relevant agencies to investigate how this failed event took place and to look into the bands."
 Beat_Music.4.d:0 "Senior members of the Socialist Union Party (SED) recently condemned recent liberalizing measures. They note these decisions have, especially in terms of music, at times radicalized the youth by encouraging capitalistic ideas and culture. The number of blatant disobediences of both parents and the state is at an unprecedented level. In addition, allowing the screening of films with criticism towards the government has only encouraged wider dissent and a bias against the Party. The SED was urged that the frustrations aired by its members reflected the views of the wider society and the liberalization experiment must be wrapped up."
 FDJ.3.d:0 "The Free German Youth (FDJ) was founded as an anti-fascist youth organization after World War II. The organization has evolved into a major state organ. Young people from age 14 to 25 join the organization where they are placed in school and provided guidance on how to function within a socialist society and be a proud party member. The organization also provides publications and media broadcasts encouraging its beliefs and socialism. However, the organization is increasingly ignored by young people and is struggling to attract committed members. Recently, a series of reforms were announced to the organization to help recommit the Party with the youth. These reforms are meant to give more authority to youth leaders and relax the strict adherence to Party directives. The FDJ will organize more concerts, dances, along with holidays, and sports competitions to provide fun activities. This will encourage more people to join."
 FDJ.10.d:0 "The Socialist Union Party (SED) announced it would reverse new policies and initiatives related to the Free German Youth (FDJ) organization. Efforts to provide a relaxation of Party directives and more fun activities has resulted in blatant youth disobedience and confusion in the group. Recent activities involving music and poetry saw performances which ran counter to socialist doctrine or ignored it completely. This only encourages more dissent and alienates youths committed to the Party. Restoring socialist commitment and reducing the latitude given to youth leaders will end any confusion within young people in the country. Despite the restoration of strict government controls, there are still plans to organize youth holidays and other leisure activities, but under a strict socialist atmosphere. Efforts to ensure more youth participation will also be enacted."
 FDJ.11.d:0 "The Socialist Union Party (SED) confirmed proposals to permanently empower the Politburo Youth Commission and give its chairman positions in key governing bodies. The Party believes this is confirmation of the unity across all generations in Germany in the effort to achieve a just socialist society. This new decision continues recent reform initiatives that began with a liberalization of the national youth organization, the FDJ. In addition to providing more spaces for public expression, the government also empowered youth leaders to help the state come up with popular policies for young people. This recent incident indicates the reforms are likely to stay and have proven satisfactory to the state."
 GDR_Econ_Failure.1.d:0 "The Seven-Year Plan ended in failure. Our goal of achieving West Germany per-capita production could not overcome major hurdles. Analysts suggest the extra productivity demands required to achieve the goal was not realistic given the current economic conditions. More importantly, the continued issue of emigration, especially of professional class individuals greatly curtailed the productive capacity of the state. The government will re-evaluate its policies and direction to ensure realistic economic goals are set and achieved by the state."
 Storfreimachung.5.d:0 "The West continues to threaten our people with threats to cut off trade and our access to essential goods. They are seeking to put us at the mercy of their demands. More importantly, they do so in conjunction with their propaganda and intelligence operations, designed to convince our people to betray the state or leave the country. In order to deal with this threat, the government announced more restrictions on Western trade, instead calling for more domestic production and efforts to find import sources from friendly socialist states. We will also continue developing the port in Rostock to further reduce Western trade and facilitate the importation of socialist goods. We must also consider ways of controlling the emigration epidemic which drains the economy."
 ddr.22.d:0 "In order to prevent Western spies and propaganda from destroying the socialist system in Germany, an Antifascist Defense Rampart is being established to separate capitalist West Berlin from our people. As the wall comes up, guard towers are being erected to better observe attempts by the West to infiltrate and to stop those misguided fools seeking the slavery of the West. The government believes this new structure is essential for the preservation of German socialism and with the reduced reliance on Western trade, erecting a closed border is far more feasible. The West has predictably reacted strongly to our actions but ultimately this marks not the closing off of Germany as they claim but the liberation of socialism within Germany."
 Liberman_Econ.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union has urged the government to adapt the recommendations of its most prominent economist, Evse Liberman. Key officials are reviewing the proposals of Liberman which offer a more dramatic shift from traditional state planning. Liberman proposes a more decentralized economic model without the pressure of annual economic benchmarks. Liberman believes giving greater flexibility and reducing the need to achieve short-term results will provide flexibility and encourage the economy to find more creative ways to achieve long-term growth. The proposals would result in a reduced wastage of raw materials and an expansion of mechanization to fuel not just higher economic growth but also more efficiency. Opponents within the Party note the proposals are unproven, biased against agriculture, and risky. A lack of centralized control could lead to complete economic stagnation if the expected creativity or innovation does not occur."
 Storfreimachung.1.d:0 "The Aktion Storfreimachung initiative sought to reduce our reliance on Western imports and replace those goods with our own production or imports from socialist states. The campaign has had successes and achieved its goal of demonstrating our resistance to Western threats. However, the main central economic bodies note the costs associated with the initiative and the planning needed to begin producing many goods is increasing at an alarming rate. The long-term health of the economy is at risk for minimal production. Also, the availability of certain goods, especially chemicals is not as readily available among our socialist allies, hindering our ability to offset costs with alternative imports. As such, the government will quietly end the program after highlighting is achievements."
 Storfreimachung.2.d:0 "The Aktion Storfreimachung initiative sought to reduce our reliance on Western imports and replace those goods with our own production or imports from socialist states. The campaign has had successes and achieved its goal of demonstrating our resistance to Western threats. However, the main central economic bodies note the costs associated with the initiative and the planning needed to begin producing many goods is increasing. This is resulting in slowed economic growth and difficulty in finding proper import sources. Despite this, the government recognizes that achieving self-reliance on the production of these goods offers long-term protection from the West and the seeds for an economic boom. As such, the program will not be slowed down but escalated. Even more goods will now be produced domestically as Germany strives to achieve complete economic self-sufficiency."
 SOVGDR_ECON.1.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic (GDR) recently sent a delegation requesting additional funding to support their economy. The GDR has ambitious plans to establish an economy superior to its capitalist neighbors in order to demonstrate the superiority of socialism and to undermine Western propaganda. The German officials admit they had underestimated the costs needed for their economic projections but insist with Soviet funds they can achieve its goals and provide a victory for the entire socialist world. We must carefully consider this request and decide if we can trust the Germans to effectively use these funds, if not, we must urge them to set realistic objectives and not try to simply spend their way out of trouble."
 SOVGDR_ECON.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union agreed to extend financial support to aid our state as we continue the process of transforming our economy and achieving growth. The Soviets agreed with our assessment that a strong, socialist Germany is the best defense against Western propaganda. The long-term benefits are also clear, when we achieve our objectives the impact of enemy propaganda will greatly reduce. The main economic bodies will be meeting in the coming weeks to decide how to best utilize the extra funding and to monitor the current economic plan."
 SOVGDR_ECON.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union rejected our request for financial support to aid our state as we continue the process of transforming our economy and achieving growth. The Soviets sympathized with our assessment of a strong socialist Germany being the key to stopping Western propaganda. However, the Soviets believed our economic problems were not due to a lack of funding but poor central planning. They urged our government to use funds more effectively and realistically in order to achieve growth. This is a major blow for the government as it expected Soviet financial support to turn the corner."
 SOV_GDR.1.d:0 "When news of the replacement of Nikita Khrushchev reached the German Democratic Republic, there was mixed reactions among the Union Socialist Party leadership. Reformers were troubled as they whole heartedly endorsed the encouragement of more liberalization both of society and the economy. However, hardliners in the party will be thrilled to see a new Soviet leader. They believed the liberalization drive only resulted in social tensions, especially between adults and the national youth. Economically, the Soviet encouragement of more decentralized state planning felt too much like capitalism. Many hardliners in the Party believe Khrushchev failed by not practicing collective leadership, a cornerstone of a socialist government."
 SOV_GDR.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union believes there needs to be leadership change within the Union Socialist Party of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Long-time GDR leader Walter Ulbricht encourages an economic model incompatible with socialism. He presses for more independence and refuses Soviet calls for him to open talks with the West, greatly damaging international socialism. There are two possible replacements for Ulbricht. Erich Honecker, a protege of Ulbricht has extensive leadership experience, especially over military affairs. He has recently turned against his mentor, opposing his economic policies and siding with traditional hardliners in the party. The other option is Horst Sindermann, another experienced leader. He is not a hardliner like Honecker but also not as liberal as Ulbricht. He offers something in between the two, which makes him an interesting option for leadership of the GDR."
 GDR_COMECON.1.d:0 "COMECON started in the early 1950s as a way to promote international trade and boost the economies of socialist European states and the Soviet Union. It was meant to create a system of cooperation. Since its foundation, most members sought to promote their own economic self-sufficiency. However, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) wishes for COMECON to more closely integrate its members economies. Especially with regards to trade and economic coordination among member states. We can accept this proposal, however, other member states may criticize us for not working towards unanimous consensus as is the established norm and more aligned to the socialist ideology."
 GDR_COMECON.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union agreed to support efforts at deepening COMECON to better coordinate the economies and trade between its member states. With our support, we hope to persuade the other socialist states to abandon their emphasis on autarky and work on creating a powerful economic zone that can better combat the capitalist threat. At the very least, we can better coordinate with the Soviets to strengthen trade ties and the economic growth of our states."
 GDR_COMECON.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union rejected our call to deepen COMECON integration and better coordinate our economies. They cite a resistance among other member states and the overabundance of requirements on the Soviet Union to achieve this. It is far better and ideologically sound to consult on individual levels and with unanimous consensus among all COMECON members. This is a bitter setback and will hinder our efforts at bringing more economic decision-making power to the non-Soviet socialist European states."
 Constitution_Reform.1.d:0 "The people of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) recently voted to adopt a new constitution for the state. The previous constitution was recently concluded to be superficial and incompatible with the socialist identity and desire of the people. The new constitution is a thoroughly communist document and much more clearly identifies the GDR as a true socialist state. This is a major victory for the government which can now claim that there is now no legal way for enemies of the state or foreign plotters to reverse the socialist identity of the GDR and its people. The results were overwhelmingly in favor of the new constitution."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.1.d:0 "The Democratic German Republic and Soviet Union are beginning negotiations regarding the German-Soviet Economic Agreement. The current structure offers highly favorable terms for the Soviets and imposes restrictions. This will hinder the ability of the German economy to revitalize and open up its markets. Reformers, like Erich Apel insists we reject the proposal and ask the Soviets to revise the agreement. However, hardliners in the party believe the concerns are ill-founded and an agreement will stabilize ties with Moscow and ensure the continued socialist development of the economy. They accuse reformers of diverting the state from a proper, socialist economic model."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.2.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic has accepted Soviet conditions for the latest Economic Agreement between the two states. The terms appeared to highly favor the Soviets at the expense of the German economy, however, these were dismissed, and senior officials insisted the terms ensure the continuation of proper socialist developments. Reformers are likely to be upset with the agreement, but it appears there concerns over the terms were not persuasive enough to convince the state to risk its relations with Moscow."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.3.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic made an unusual request regarding the proposed Economic Agreement treaty. They wish to change certain elements, especially those related to trade and planning. The Germans believe these conditions are harmful to their development and economic objectives. Our own economic officials note this may be true, but the conditions ensure favorable opportunities for the Soviet economy. For the sake of greater cooperation and trust, we can accept these changes, though losing the advantages that would come from the original proposal. We could also reject the proposal, this would show our displeasure and pressure them to not move away from our guidance, as ultimately they cannot survive without our help."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.4.d:0 "The Soviet Union accepted our terms to revise the proposed Economic Agreement treaty. We asked for the removal of certain terms which benefitted the Soviets at the expense of our own trade and economic development. The Soviet agreement signifies their commitment to maintaining ties and recognition of us as a partner and not client. The new agreement is being widely praised by reformers in the party who will feel increasingly emboldened to push the state towards policies that can cause growth, not stagnation."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.5.d:0 "The Soviet Union rejected our terms to revise the proposed Economic Agreement treaty. We asked for the removal of certain terms which benefitted the Soviets at the expense of our own trade and economic development. The Soviet rejection indicates their displeasure. The Soviets argued the original agreement ensures positive growth for the entire socialist world and our revisions reflected selfishness. The hardliners in the party will be infuriated by the result, as we desperately need Soviet economic and political aid. The reformers are disappointed an agreement could not be reached but will be satisfied the state is not committed to a compromising agreement."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.6.d:0 "We recently concluded a new German-Soviet Economic Agreement. This confirms the continued, historic, and deep ties between our states. Although there were some issues in negotiations, a final agreement was signed to the satisfaction of both parties. The Soviets succeeded in strengthening relations while we were able to secure more equitable terms than we have in the past. There is increased optimism that this marks a new era of greater cooperation and equality between the two states."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.7.d:0 "The German-Soviet Economic Agreement has finally been ratified by our government and the German Democratic Republic. This new treaty confirms the strong ties between us and the Germans. We acquiesced to several German requests which did hinder the overall benefits we receive from the treaty. However, in the name of greater socialist cooperation and strengthening the economy of a key ally, we accepted this. We hope the Germans will recognize our generosity and, in the future, return the favor."
 Uberholen_ohne_Einzuholen.1.d:0 "The Socialist Union Party of Germany will initiate a new economic policy called uberholen ohne einzuholen "overtaking without catching up." The plan calls for the GDR to focus on investing and developing certain key, high yield sectors of the economy to promote explosive growth. The profits from this will pay back the debt required to support this growth and allow us to overtake the capitalist West Germany within the next five years. By investing heavily in these key industries, the GDR plans to achieve a major economic leap from which to it can not only bridge but overtake the gap between it and the West without having to invest in the entire economy."
 Uberholen_ohne_Einzuholen.2.d:0 "When the policy of uberholen ohne einzuholen "overtaking without catching up" was first laid out, many in the state were skeptical. There was concerns about the accumulation of debt required to achieve rapid investment in the key industries. There was also major concern with how the other sectors of the economy would fair during this time. Despite these concerns, the gamble has paid off. The GDP of the GDR is now higher than West Germany. The world is stunned by the rapid innovation and infrastructure we developed for those key industries. The demand for GDR technology and the profits from it will easily allow us to pay off debt while growing the economy. The economic gap with the West is no more."
 Uberholen_ohne_Einzuholen.3.d:0 "When the policy of uberholen ohne einzuholen "overtaking without catching up" was first laid out, many in the state were skeptical. There was concerns about the accumulation of debt required to achieve rapid investment in the key industries. There was also major concern with how the other sectors of the economy would fair during this time. Unfortunately, these concerns were well-founded. The increase in debt put immense pressure on financing and outside sources for more cash dried faster than growth could be achieved. The rapid growth also did not materialize, especially since the neglected sectors failed to meet the production needs required for growth. The GDP gap still exists and may have become more prominent as the government must now seek a way to revitalize the economy and control its burdensome debt. The expected leap failed to materialize."
 FDJ.5.d:0 "Hundreds of thousands of youth delegates from across West and East Germany met in East Berlin for the [GetYear] Deutschlandtreffen (German National Youth Conference). Over the event period there were dances, social events, and parties organized for the participants. It created a relaxed, open atmosphere for all who attended. The Socialist Union Party praised the widespread participation of young people at the events and directed state media to broadcast the activities. There is a genuine feeling of openness and freedom among the attendees, though there was some who noted an absence of extensive socialist discussions or themes at times."
 FDJ.6.d:0 "As part of the 1964 Deutschlandtreffen (German National Youth Conference) a new radio station began broadcasting. It is called Sonderstudio Deutschlandtreffen, which is already being abbreviated to DT-64. The station will offer hours of news, entertainment, and popular music, especially beat music. The station also features live broadcasts, something very uncommon on the radio in the GDR. Attendees at the Deutschlandtreffen describe the programs and music as perfect for the event and feeling of young people in the country. The station will even be permitted to play popular western songs."
 Berlin_Wall.1.d:0 "The people of Berlin are realizing a new reality as a concrete wall continues to be constructed across the border separating East Berlin from West Berlin. The construction began a week ago when GDR forces closed border entrances, setup barbwire, and blocked the border to prevent vehicle movement. Over the next days, concrete barricades were erected to setup construction of a wall to separate the city. The construction is being done within East Berlin to prevent any Western complaints or plots. The barricade, being called the Berlin Wall is meant to prevent illegal movement of citizens, halt Western propaganda, and end nefarious plots by enemies of the state. The West has predictably reacted with outrage."
 Berlin_Wall.2.d:0 "The GDR announced new movement restrictions on travel between West and East Berlin. East Berliners are not permitted to travel across. There may eventually be exceptions given to elderly pensioners, visits to important family matters, and if someone must travel for professional reasons. Westerners and West Berliners are not permitted to cross to East Berlin. There will be nine border crossings under strict border controls. There are currently plans to consider visa applications and close scrutiny at border crossings. GDR border troops are authorized to use lethal force to stop anyone from attempting to illegally cross the border."
 GDR_SAGA.1.d:0 "When the GDR was founded, it inherited outdated laws and penal codes, including those from the Nazi regime. This included laws which criminalized homosexuality and the "seduction" of men by other men. The government has not enforced these laws for a number of years, but it was recently decided to reform these laws and decriminalize homosexuality. The Socialist Union Party of Germany views homosexuality as neither an illness nor a legitimate sexual identity. Socialist doctrine views homosexuals as "non-reproductive" and they face general exclusion in the party. Despite these social issues, the GDR is one of the few European states to have legalized homosexuality."
 DDR_Stasi.1.d:0 "In recent weeks there has been a mass release of prisoners across the GDR, especially political prisoners. The Socialist Union Party of Germany is experimenting with a policy of liberalism. These releases are meant to garner support from the people and loosen the atmosphere. The infusion of these released prisoners is also expected to provide a boost for the economy and makeup for the loss of population due to emigration."
 SOV_GDR.5.d:0 "Walter Ulbrich recently stepped down as First Secretary of the Socialist Union Party of Germany, citing health issues. The Party confirmed his replacement is Erich Honecker, who will take the post of First Secretary and become the new leader of the Democratic German Republic (GDR). Erich Honecker previously held senior positions in the Politburo, with extensive experience in defense. Many experts were not surprised as Honecker was being groomed for leadership by Ulbricht. Though there are rumors the two men had a recent falling out over the economy. Honecker promised he will establish a unity of economic and social policies. Promising an era of stability and social growth."
 SOV_GDR.6.d:0 "Walter Ulbrich recently stepped down as First Secretary of the Socialist Union Party of Germany, citing health issues. The Party confirmed his replacement is Horst Sindermann, who will take the post of First Secretary and become the new leader of the Democratic German Republic (GDR). Sindermann, a long-term party leader is seen by many to be a compromise choice between reformers and hardliners in the party. He is expected to adjust economic, social, and foreign relations, but experts do not believe these will end up being major changes."
 Ulbricht_Doctrine.1.d:0 "German Democratic Republic leader Walter Ulbricht unveiled a new doctrine, being coined the Ulbrict Doctrine, with regards to relations with West Germany. The doctrine states simply that diplomatic relations and normalization can only occur if both states mutually recognized the legitimacy and sovereignty of their states. West Germany has long asserted they are the only true German state, but there is an increasing pressure for some engagement. Other European socialist states pledged to downgrade their own contacts with West Germany until they agree to recognize GDR sovereignty. The GDR hopes its new policy will put pressure on West Germany to engage with mutual respect."
 GDR_COMECON.5.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic (GDR) signed a series of Mutual Assistance Agreements with its socialist neighbors. These reflect a wider effort by the GDR to press for more engagement with its neighbors. More importantly, it hopes to expand economic, diplomatic, and military ties to leverage support in our issues with West Germany. Being able to call upon such support will protect us from hostile action and give us more flexibility with regards to our reliance on major powers like the Soviet Union."
 DDR_Foriegn.1.d:0 "First Secretary [DDR.GetLeader] has condemned West Germany and NATO for their arrogance and interference in German affairs. He accused West Germany of heightening tensions and continuously denying the sovereignty of the GDR, with the objective of provoking a violent confrontation. NATO enables the intransigent West German attitude by deploying hostile military forces and organizing a massive propaganda campaign meant to undermine German socialism and provoke violence within our borders. The powerful speech concluded with a promise that the GDR is aware of these machinations and remains committed to protecting the state."
 ESS.1.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic (GDR) announced the initiation of a new Economic System of Socialism. The planned policy promises to restore central planning and focus heavily on high technology to establish self-sufficient economic growth. The initiative is meant to rapidly expand the economy to compete with the West and silence critics who argue previous economic models lacked socialistic characteristics. The plan inherently reduces funding for other sectors in the economy but the boost the economy expects to receive will offset any issues related to stagnation in those sectors or increasing debt."
 ESS.2.d:0 "German Democratic Republic (GDR) leader Erich Honecker spelled out his Unity of Economic and Social Policy in a recent address. The GDR would no longer work to compete with capitalism and surpass it, a policy that often led to dangerous ideological compromises. Instead the GDR will strive to build a socialist society and working class. The purpose of the economy will be to achieve the political goals laid out by the state and party. From this policy, a socialist political system will triumph for the betterment of the workers and state."
 Ulbricht_Doctrine.2.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic (GDR) openly rejected Soviet pressure to hold talks with West Germany. The GDR insists talks will be held on its terms which are that West Germany recognize the legitimacy and sovereignty of it. The Soviets are seeking to reduce tensions in Europe and court West Germany in order to wean it away from the United States. The decision by the GDR will likely annoy Moscow and put the recent peace effort in jeopardy."
 SOV_GDR_NEG.10.d:0 "Former rocket engineer and key economic advisor for the German Democratic Republic (GDR), Erich Apel was discovered dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The death has stunned many in the Socialist Union Party of Germany. Apel, a key advocate for economic reforms, in recent weeks was said to have increased his influence over First Secretary [DDR.GetLeader]. The government announced a thorough investigation will take place, however, there are rumors that the suicide may have been staged by hardliners or Soviet agents. Allegedly there was concern that Apel was on the verge of convincing a major shift in economic policy for the GDR. Regardless of the truth, the death will be a major blow for reformers."
 Uberholen_ohne_Einzuholen.4.d:0 "The German Democratic Republic (GDR) announced its economic reports confirmed that its GDP finally surpassed that of West Germany. This is a major victory for the Economic System of Socialism policy initiated by the GDR several years earlier. The economic plan restored central planning and focused production on several key, high technology industries. The plan required the accumulation of debt and neglect of other sectors in the economy. The gamble paid off as the growth achieved fueled rapid economic liftoff, enabling this great achievement."
 FDJ.1.d:0 "The Socialist Union Party of Germany must decide whether to reform The Free German Youth (FDJ). The organization was originally founded as an anti-fascist youth organization but has evolved into an arm of the state and party. It provides guidance for young people on future careers and how to function in a socialist society. However, in recent years, participation to the organization has declined. There appears to be growing apathy among the youth over pursuing socialist teaching. There are calls for reforms that will bring more leisurely activities and make youth organizations more attractive for young people and reverse this generational gap. Opponents to the reform complain it does not adhere to strict socialist indoctrination and will backfire by encouraging contradictory thoughts, loosen socialist morality and social norms."

 GDR_ECON.1.d:0 "The Soviet Control Commission recently sent a report detailing our economic development. The Soviets have criticized the policy of accelerating socialism through collectivization and other policies. The report notes this has alienated many professionals who have fled the country, devastating the economic health of the country. They recommend a step back from collectivization and focus on economic diversification. Some in the government agree with the analysis and believe we should accept the recommendations. However, senior party members believe the Soviet analysis ignores key realities and the long-term growth that will lead to an economic boom."
 GDR_ECON.2.d:0 "The government announced the transfer of ministers from industries to the State Planning of Commission. This will greatly strengthen economic efficiency. The action indicates a renewed focus on heavy industry and mining. This new structure will encourage a system of the people planning the economy for the state. Economic reports from local authorities will now be more readily analyzed and responded to by the central authority. The State Planning Commission is now much closer to the Council of Ministers in terms of economic planning."
 Storfreimachung.0.d:0 "West Germany continues its threats to pull out of our international trade arrangement. They foolishly think they can leverage trade and our need for Western imports against us. In response, the Party announced a new policy, Akiton Sorfreimachung. It will direct the government to seek import needs from alternative sources and reduce our need for West German goods. Goods normally imported will now be produced by our own factories while materials and machinery can be brought from the Soviet Union and our socialist allies in Europe."
 GDR_ECON.0.d:0 "The government announced the establishment of the State Planning Commission (SPC). It will work closely with the Council of Ministers to help develop state economic policy on a national level. It will help determine the proper placement of new industries and housing among its responsibilities. The government believes the SPC will promote a more focused and efficient economic vision for the state and government. The chairman of the commission will sit on the Council of Ministers."  
 
 ddr.1.t:0 "Increased Work Quotas"
 ddr.1.d:0 "The heads of the state industrial sector have been pushing for increased work quotas for many months.

 ddr.3.d:0 "The Deutsche Demokratische Republik, otherwise known as East Germany, was founded in the Soviet occupied zone of Germany today. The establishment of the GDR seals the division of Germany that happened in 1945. West Germany had already gained independence from the occupying powers earlier in 1949, and the creation of East Germany meant the same for the formerly Soviet-zone, although the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany maintained close ties with the USSR and was therefore seen as a satellite state."

 ddr.40.d:0 "In the early morning hours of December 19, 1975, a shooting incident took place at the inter-German border, on the boundary line between Thuringia and Bavaria, near the East German town of Hildburghausen. According to West German border guards on duty at the time, the moonlit calm of a cold and clear winter night was disrupted around 2:25 a.m. by the sound of sub-machine gun fire from the eastern side of the boundary. During the next hours plenty of additional commotion ensued on East German territory: border soldiers combed the terrain behind the border; officers drove around directing the proceedings; helicopters buzzed overhead. Based on their observation of similar past incidents, West German authorities quickly deduced what had probably taken place: an attempted escape across the heavily fortified inner German border."

 ddr.41.d:0 "The West German Government has denied the extradition of Werner Weinhold to us. This is an insult, and unacceptable for us.

Should we let the West Germans deal with him or do we apply pressure on the West Germans?"

 ddr.42.d:0 "The government of the DDR has began to build a barbed wire and concrete "Antifascistischer Schutzwall," or "antifascist bulwark," between East and West Berlin. The official purpose of this Berlin Wall has been told is to keep Western "fascists" from entering East Germany and undermining the socialist state, but some think it primarily serves the objective of stemming mass defections from East to West. The president of the USA said "a wall is a hell of a lot better than a war.""
 ddr.42.a:0 "This signals an even deeper partition"
 ddr.43.d:0 "Friedrich Wilhelm Reinhold Pieck has just died in his apartment at Majakowskiring 29, Pankow, East Berlin. In 1949, he became the first President of the German Democratic Republic, an office abolished upon his death."
 Honecker.100.d:0 "Erich Honecker has just been chosen as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party in German Democratic Republic. Honecker is a self-stated hardliner who on several occasions butted heads with the Soviets and as such, was seen as the best choice for GDR. During his inauguration speech his staunch anti-liberal platform garnered much support from Cuba, North Korea, and countless hardline socialists worldwide. West Germany accused Honecker for committing atrocities by overseeing the construction and operation of the Berlin Wall."
 Prussia_cul.1.d:0 "Frederick the Great IS the greatest leader Germany ever had. He rose Prussia from nothing to a force to be reckoned with. It's time we once again embrace his legacy. The DDR announced the establishment of a holiday in honor of Frederick the Great. The week of the holiday will feature daily military parades and festivals celebrating Prussia. Western European commentators are already calling it an Eastern Oktoberfest."
 Prussia_cul.2.d:0 "The Ninety-Five Theses of Martin Luther enabled the people of Europe defy the Papacy and the Empire. In a way we owe Luther for the rise of Germany. Our Germany, not the lies of Habsburgs and Popes."

 Prussia_Spring.5.d:0 "The East German regime announced today that the German Democratic Republic would be undertaking a radical shift of economic policy similar to that of Josip Tito's Yugoslavia. This action is met with mixed feelings and general suspicion from the Soviet Union."
 Prussia_Spring.6.d:0 "Once more the Junkers and Hohenzollerns rise! Until the dying days of the Weltkrieg we held the world in fear. We failed then, we will not fail again. More than 30 years since the abdication of Wilhelm II the Hohenzollern dynasty has returned to Prussia and taken their place as monarchs of Prussia. Objections from the United Kingdom and France were issued the same day."
 Prussia_Spring.3.d:0 "When we lost the war, eastern Germany was enslaved by the Bolshevik menace. We suffered countless indignities inflicted by the Soviets. No more will we be their puppet. The newly reestablished Kingdom of Prussia announced that withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact was imminent. No mention was made of the other Soviet led organizations that Germany was a part of, but NATO experts predict that Prussia would leave them all."
 Prussia_Spring.4.d:0 "Soviet Revisionism is a pollutant to the ideas of Marx. Chairman Mao taught us much, and now we break our chains and rally the people. We will unite Germany as Mao freed China. In an unexpected turn of events the East German leadership denounced the Soviet leadership and threatened to withdraw from the Comecon. The German Ambassador recently took part in a high-profile diplomatic mission to China, and now the purpose was clear that Germany sought an alliance with Communist China."
 NDP.1.d:0 "Despite what the Allies said, we aren't free. They manipulate our nation, steal our resources and our rightful land. Hitler stood against the west and now the next generation of Germans is ready to take their stand. Early this morning West German police were called once again to disperse a rally led by the Neo-Nazi NDP. The government and NATO both made statements that condemned the party and its actions, but it seems the police actions have been inefficient and polls for the upcoming elections predict the NDP gaining a handful of seats."
 NDP.2.d:0 "When Hitler led our Reich, our borders stretched from Spain to the gates of Moscow. Our army undefeated, our people overjoyed. Then at the peak of our power it fell apart. This time we right the wrongs and conquer the Bolsheviks. Today Germany saw itself united after a referendum that left most of the world stunned. Once more the fascists are in control of Germany. NATO has made no comment, but protest speeches have already begun at the United Nations with the Polish representative leading the protests likely on behalf of the Soviet Union."
 DDR_prussa_unify.1.d:0 "18, January 1871 in the halls of the Sun King, Germany was finally united. We usurped France as the masters of Europe, and now our Kaisers return. Our Reich will finally take its place in the sun. The Kingdom of Prussia once again became the catalyst for the unification of Germany under one leader after a lengthy campaign of reunification. After negotiations with the former West German Government the reunification was finalized at the Versailles Palace, though this time they only asked to book the venue rather than invade France."
 DDR_unify.1.d:0 "Germany has suffered endlessly since the end of the war. Us more than the West. Both our people clamor for the wall to come down and to join arms united again. After decades of separation the people of Berlin tore down the wall that had not only separated the people of Germany but killed those who had tried to cross it. The footage of the wall's destruction was broadcast to millions across the world and is already being lauded as one of the most significant events of the century."

It is relatively advanced car with front wheel drive, unitary construction and independent suspension.\nThe engine is a small, 500cc air cooled two-stroke making 18hp. This means the car can reach a max of 100 km/h.\nThe average wait time for the new car is 10 years, but under socialism we are in no hurry."

This became increasingly critical as the GDR faced increasing economic problems due to his failed reforms, and other countries refused to offer any kind of assistance. His refusal to seek rapprochement with West Germany on Soviet terms, and his rejection of détente infuriated the Soviet leadership. Now it's time to force him to retire \"due to reasons of poor health\". For his replacement there are two candidates, Moscow favored Erich Honecker or more liberal Horst Sindermann."
 ddr.21.d:0 "Almost immediately after our liberation by the Soviets, people have deserted the republic to join the imperialist and capitalist West Germany. In the 1950s we attempted to restrict the people from leaving and stigmatize Republikflucht, including requiring de-registration with East German authorities and permission to the leave the country under threat of prison sentences up to three years. We even put out a propaganda booklet in hopes of stopping the people. But, despite all of our efforts, millions of people have already left and millions will leave unless we do something about it."

 ###East Austria Events (Who tf put them in East Germany Localisation)###
 
 ADR.1.d:0 "Today in the wake of growing fascist violence, the Austrian Democratic Republic announced a wave of sweeping political reforms aimed at cleansing the nation of all physical and psychologic relics of National Socialism. Already, many statutes alluding to German supremacy or Austrian nationalism have been torn down, strict laws around Austrian history have been put in place, and suspected fascist sympathizers have disappeared from public life. While many dissidents believe these acts to be just as fascist as the intended targets, many have pointed out that since embarking, Nazi paramilitary violence and hate crimes have plummeted."
 ADR.2.d:0 "Yesterday the General Secretary Johann Koplenig released a statement criticizing the West Austrian government for denying the Austrian worker the right to choose “a true Austrian state”. Koplenig has called for an election in both states to decide whether or not to unify under a “neutral workers state”. This request has been widely condemned as an act of political theater designed to destabilize West Austria and give East Austria the moral high ground. Although nontransparent, Koplenigs statement has already seen a rise in far-left activism in West Austria."
 ADR.3.d:0 "The duty of the KPO shall be the protection of the revolution, the advancement of the Austrian worker, and the retention of world peace. Undermining or outright opposing any of these duties is tantamount to treason."
 ADR.4.d:0 "goal is to recreate the power and scale of the reactionary Austro-Hungarian Empire, this time, however, for the benefit of its workers and peasants. As of now, the Volkswirshaftpakt is an insignificant collection of trade deals and tooling licenses but with work and unity, it shall grow into a pact stronger than steel."
 ADR.5.d:0 "Czechoslovak Republic signed the Volkswirshaftpakt, an economic pact aiming for “a complete dissolution of borders and trade restrictions between all member states”. As of now, the pact is little more than a few minor trade deals on timber and bauxite, but many predict it has the potential to become a powerful economic and military alliance that will play a dominant role in European Diplomacy."
 ADR.7.d:0 "returned after the war to rebuild our great capital of Vienna. However, since then, he has used up all his good will with the party by being an outspoken critic of central planning and the one party state. If we are to progress any further, Korner must be eliminated from the public spotlight. Because of his background, it would be foolish to execute him. Instead, Korner will be fired and barred from holding any public office."
 ADR.8.d:0 "now stand at the edge of a bright future filled with prosperity, unity, and labor. Yet, there is still much work to be done. Our borders remain porous and weak, allowing reactionaries and dissidents to travel in and out almost unopposed. Our factories, while examples of socialist modernity, still lack efficiency. Volkswirshaftpakt, while a promising start, is only a piece of paper. These issues and many others will be solved in the coming decades as we demonstrate the true power of the Austrian worker."
 ADR.9.d:0 "Today, General Secretary Johann Koplenig of the Austrian Democratic Republic drastically increased tensions with West Austria in an infamous speech calling for “an immediate overthrow of the illegitimate and treasonous government in occupied Austria”. This speech has already brought condemnation from both the United States and Soviet Union, believing it to be an unnecessary provocation in one of the most tense regions of the world. Although criticized by both world powers, the speech, known in Austria as “Die Rede der Verräterischen Brüder” or “Traitorous Bothers Speech”, has been widely popular among the East Austrian population. Koplenig has already received a wave of support in the form of a massive swelling of the KPO. In West Austria, sporadic instances of peaceful dissidence among the working class has seen a sharp increase, although it is highly unlikely a   revolt will occur in the foreseeable future. Regardless of the speeches effect internationally, it appears it has accomplished the primary goal of popularizing the communist movement in the eyes of the East Austrian people."
 ADR.10.d:0 "Yesterday, musicians across the Warsaw pact and beyond gathered in Vienna for the first annual Einheinskonzert. The Einheinskonzert according to the East Austrian Government is “an event where socialist states around the world can exchange culture and artistic achievement free from capitalistic censorship”. Notable attendees of the concert were the Soviet Alexandrov Ensemble, the DDRs Erich-Weinhert Ensemble, the Korean People's Army State Merited Chorus and Symphony Orchestra, The Central Band of the Polish People's Army, and the Ensemble of the Bulgarian Armed Forces. East Austrian officials have hinted that the Einheinskonzert will make a return in five years, as the event has both legitimized East Austria as a sovereign nation and generated millions of dollars in tourist revenue."
 ADR.11.d:0 "Today, East Austrian General Secretary Johann Koplenig declared Austria “the first victim of fascist imperialism”. In the same statement, Koplenig expressed the idea that the Austrian people were nothing more than a stepping stone toward world domination and the total destruction of post-enlightenment values. While appearing to be a small development in a small country, many correspondents believe that the acceptance of East Austrian victimhood signifies the end of denazification for the small Central European nation, as the population has come to recognize the danger of fascism to both the Austrian state and people. Yet, some are not as enthusiastic. Many in the Jewish community have denounced the recent statement on the grounds that it removes the national guilt from the holocaust. Regardless of implications, it is clear that a dark chapter in Austrian history is closing."
 ADR.12.d:0 "Western Europe has been rocked today as for the first time since being divided, East Austria has overtaken the West Austrian economy. While still having a considerably smaller GDP per capita, the East Austrian economy has grown at a shocking pace over the last few years, becoming richer than many small European nations. Although there are many reasons for this success, the biggest one appears to be East Austria's willingness to enter western markets. In a public statement, General Secretary Johann Koplenig joked that “our success is owed to the West German, British, and American consumer just as much as it is to our own peoples industrial spirit”. This victory for socialism has sent shockwaves across the world and many question the true strength of Capitalism."
 ADR.13.d:0 "Today, citizens of Vienna awoke to a massive construction site on the border with East Austria. Much like their German comrades, East Austria has begun constructing a massive wall along the border with Western Vienna. Officially, the East Austrians have stated that these fortifications are for “the protection of the Austrian revolution against NATO imperialism”. Many believe however that the true purpose of the Wall will be to halt massive illegal immigration out of the country. Many in West Austria are concerned for their countrymen behind the iron curtain and some fear East Austria will become a prison state."
 ADR.14.d:0 "While on a diplomatic trip to Moscow, East Austrian General Secretary Johann Koplenig was deposed by a moderate clan within the KPO lead by social democrat Franz Jonas. The event, commonly referred to as the October Coup, is likely to bring about a new era in East Austria. Jonas has already announced his intentions to expel all foreign troops from Austrian soil, break the one party rule of the KPO, and allow the Austrian people to reunite. Across West Austria and NATO, there is much celebration as the possibility for a peaceful Austrian unification becomes likely. The USSR has harshly condemned the October Coup and have called for the immediate removal of Jonas. Many rumors circulate of a possible Soviet invasion as Warsaw Pact troop movements convene on the Austrian border. However, experts in the region believe that due to the mountainous terrain and potential Austrian resistance, any invasion of East Austria would be a costly endeavor."
 ADR.15.d:0 "Today, the final barricades and barbed separating the East and West Austrian border were removed, as two nations become one. East Austria, having just ousted communist rule, held an election international observers have judged “free and fair” to reunite with West Austria. Although choosing to rejoin West Austria, the result of the election was not a foregone conclusion, with the anti-unification votes gaining 46% and the pro-unification votes gaining 54%. Now that the country is unified, Austrian officials will have to deal with many problems such as integrating the power grid, standardizing Eastern and Western Units in the Army, and of course dealing with a large minority of people who prefer communist rule. Internationally, this event has been deeply troubling for the USSR and her allies as a piece of the Iron Curtain is chipped away. The Soviets have already swelled garrisons in Eastern Europe, and it is clear they won't let this happen again."
 ADR.16.d:0 "In the wake of political instability, East Austria has unleashed a purge of the KPO and Red Army. This has come as a surprise, as many international observers believed East Austria to be one of the most stable nations in the Eastern Bloc. Many notable reformist politicians such as Franz Jonas have been charged with high treason and were sentenced to death. The official East Austrian statement as of now is that the KPO is under a period of reorganization and many in the state apparatus are unfit to govern in the new political climate. The East Austrian Government has denounced the purges as “slanderous lies” yet it is clear that many KPO moderates have been deposed from local and state positions"
 ADR.17.d:0 "Today, the Democratic Republic of Austria announced the death of General Secretary Johann Koplenig. After struggling with cancer for many years, Koplenig passed away in his bed. A state funeral has been organized, and it is expected that many communists from around the world will attend. As of now, the future of the Austrian Democratic Republic is up in the air. While officially the seat of General Secretary has been filled by Franz Muhri, many in the KPO believe the future of the party belongs to Comintern veteran and liberalizer Ernst Fischer. Whoever consolidates power will decide the future of Austria."
 ADR.18.d:0 "Today, Franz Muhri was appointed General Secretary of the KPO and leader of the Austrian Democratic Republic. Muhri has bold new plans for Austria, most notably, an expansion of Central European economic cooperation, and greater support for revolutionaries in the Third World. As well as a new vision for Austria, the new General Secretary believes the key to East Austrias success is a strong relationship with the USSR. Regardless of personal conviction, Muhri has assured Moscow that the Austrian Democratic Republic will remain loyal to the Soviet Union."
 ADR.19.d:0 "Today, Ernst Fischer was appointed General Secretary of the KPO and leader of the Austrian Democratic Republic. Fischer has bold new plans for Austria, including vast economic reforms and greater cultural freedoms. Although having toed the soviet line since Austria split, the new General Secretary has condemned Soviet influence in central and Eastern Europe after the Prague Spring. These statements have alienated him from the rest of the Eastern Bloc. Moscow has warned that any action to leave will be met with a Soviet withdrawal of economic and political support."
 ADR.20.d:0 "Last night, citizens from around the eastern bloc flocked to Vienna to witness an East Austrian production called John Brown: The Musical. John Brown: The Musical depicts the exploits of the abolitionist and failed American revolutionary John Brown and his attempt to inspire a slave revolt in the antebellum south. East Austria announced work on the musical only a few months ago as the start of numerous high-budget theater productions aimed at boosting cultural and entertainment satisfaction among the Austrian People. Despite a rocky production, John Brown: The Musical has received numerous shining reviews by international critics, siting the incredible performances, brilliant writing, symbolic references to contemporary socialist movements. Although suffering from backroom infighting, the passion displayed by the artistic team was able to create a masterpiece. Critical acclaim has cemented John Brown: The Musical as a shining example of artistic progress under a socialist government. This success has emboldened the Ministry of Culture to allow greater artistic freedom and increase arts funding further."
 ADR.21.d:0 "Last night, citizens from around the eastern bloc flocked to Vienna to witness an East Austrian production called John Brown: The Musical. John Brown: The Musical depicts the exploits of the abolitionist and failed American revolutionary John Brown and his attempt to inspire a slave revolt in the antebellum south. East Austria announced work on the musical only a few months ago as the start of numerous high-budget theater productions aimed at boosting cultural and entertainment satisfaction among the Austrian People. Despite promoting it as a staple of East Austria, the John Brown: The Musical has received numerous bad reviews by international critics. Although resonating passion from all parties involved in artistic development, the play suffered from last minute budget cuts causing a lack of stage space, poor audio quality, and “horrific costume design”. Critical disaster has doomed John Brown: The Musical to a footnote in East Austrian History. Already, the Ministry of Culture has already retracted all statements and promotional material for the production in an attempt to erase the fiasco from public memory."
 ADR.22.d:0 "The Ministry of Culture has promised that John Brown: The Musical will be our great nations path to greatness. Strong artistic talent will both develop the East Austrian spirit and provide the country with much-needed tourist revenue. Despite our bold plans, the artistic team behind the production has requested more money and time for the musical and has warned that without the proper funding, the play could turn into an unmitigated disaster. While we want to give it the best chance possible, many planners have urged us to keep funding in more important areas of the economy. What should we do?"
 ADR.23.d:0 "It is time that we transform Volkswirtschaftspakt from a loose collection of minor trade deals into a true symbol of Central European socialist cooperation. One thing stands in the way, however. While the STASI has informed us that the Soviet Union likely has no idea of our future plans, preceding with central european economic cooperation without the USSRs approval could spark a Soviet invasion. We must tell them everything and ask for a greenlight."
 ADR.24.d:0 "Today, the Austrian Democratic Republic has requested a dramatic expansion of Volkswirtschaftspakt. Currently, Volkswirtschaftspakt is but a loose and incoherent mess of trade deals between the ADR, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. However, we believe that with time, it could become a solid economic bloc. While some in the party are enthusiastic to support European integration, some are wary of relinquishing influence. This pact could get out of hand and cause us to lose control over many fellow socialist nations in the Warsaw Pact."
 ADR.25.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Soviets have rejected our request to expand Volkswirtschaftspakt, believing that any further economic integration would be unnecessary. This has been a major disappointment, and many in the KPO have condemned the Soviets. Although Volkswirtschaftspakt is dead, our economy can still thrive."
 ADR.26.d:0 "The USSR has accepted our request to expand Volkswirtschaftspakt! Although initially uneasy about our proposal, the Soviets were swayed by our skilled diplomats who assured them that East Austria would continue to remain a loyal socialist ally. With a green light, we can now fully commit to central european economic cooperation without fear of a Soviet intervention."
 ADR.27.d:0 "Our economy is booming, yet it still lags behind the western government. If we are to cement our position as the legitimate Austria in the eyes of the world, we must overtake the West Austrian Economy and lift our people into the modern era. The key to our success lies in diversification and foreign cooperation. A victory for us is a victory for socialism and all Austrian people. Failure will be the humiliation of our fatherland."

Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948."
