Binh_Cung_Leadership.1.t:0 "General Nguyen Binh's Sacrifice"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.1.d:0 "On September 29, 1951, at the personal request of the Central Government, Comrade Binh left our safe zones to take on a new dangerous mission. Despite our previous scouting and a detachment of elite bodyguards, we have received the sad news, during an ambush in Sre Doc commune, Se San district, Stung Treng province, Cambodge, an elite French colonial force gunned down the General who fought bravely and managed to inflict heavy causalities in the enemies's sides. The commander of the protection force at that time was battalion-level officer Nguyen Van Si who had telegraphed our HighComm to confirm General Binh's sacrifice."
Binh_Cung_Leadership.1.a:0 "General Binh is always in our hearts, his soul shall fight on!"

Binh_Cung_Leadership.2.t:0 "Brigadier Nguyen Binh's Death"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.2.d:0 "On September 29, 1951, after years of tracking, our intelligence and the Khmer scouts were able to track down and confirm the identity of famed Southern Vietminh's Commander-in-chief: Brigadier Nguyen-Binh. Despite our well-prepared and executed plan and exploited the element of surprise, we suffered some casualties but were able to hunt the Southern Vietminh's leader down in Sre Doc commune, Se San district, Stung Treng province, Cambodge with some captured Vietminh soldiers have confirmed that the cadaver is the famed Brigadier himself and was reverified by our photos and intel dossiers…"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.2.a:0 "A brave man is gone! But this is a great blow to the Vietminh's Esprit de Corps!"

Binh_Cung_Leadership.3.t:0 "General Nguyen Binh's Daring Escape"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.3.d:0 "On September 29, 1951, at the personal request of the Central Government, Comrade Binh left our safe zones to take on a new dangerous mission. With the help of our Khmer allies and a detachment of elite bodyguards, we were able to push back a French ambush in Sre Doc commune, Se San district, Stung Treng province, Cambodge, while the elite French colonial forces managed to inflict heavy causalities in our sides but the General able to escape albeit wounded. The commander of the protection force at that time was battalion-level officer Nguyen Van Si who had telegraphed our HighComm to confirm General Binh's daring escape!"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.3.a:0 "Lady Luck smiles again!"

Binh_Cung_Leadership.4.t:0 "Nguyen Binh's Escapes Again"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.4.d:0 "On September 29, 1951, despite years of tracking and wasting countless francs, our intelligence and the Khmer scouts were able to track down and lose the trails of famed Southern Vietminh's Commander-in-chief: Brigadier Nguyen-Binh. Despite our well-prepared and executed plan and exploited the element of surprise, we suffered light casualties but were not able to hunt the Southern Vietminh's leader down in Sre Doc commune, Se San district, Stung Treng province, Cambodge. While we have captured some Vietminh soldiers and officers but the main target: the trickster escaped … yet again!"
Binh_Cung_Leadership.4.a:0 "We'll get him next time..."

Binh_Cung_Leadership.5.d:0 "According to the Xac-te, Kieu-Cong-Cung was a Vietminh Brigadier, who was engaged in the communist resistance against French rule in Vietnam, while he was adhering to Marxist principles of class struggle and anti-imperialism. However, following the death of Brigadier Nguyen-Binh after our successful raid, Cung's influence waned. His promotion of a more moderate Nationalistic take on Marxism, which emphasized individual empowerment and economic development within a capitalist framework, diverged from the Vietminh's Marxist ideology. This ideological shift, coupled with internal Viet-minh’s internal power struggles and external pressures from Moscow, led to his purge from the Viet Minh. The Xac-te has received news that Cung has succeeded in defecting to the PRC ( if ROC won in the mainland then: Cung has escaped to the Southern provinces ) and confirmed that Cung has tried to unsuccessfully contact our government and he has since urged us to accept him in to struggle against Viet-minh’s madness and failure in preserving the Vietnamese culture."
Binh_Cung_Leadership.6.d:0 "According to our Military intelligence, Kieu Cong Cung, a former Vietminh Brigadier, had initially engaged in the resistance against French colonial rule in Vietnam, following the Marxist principles of class struggle and anti-imperialism. However, after the demise of Brigadier Nguyen Binh under the French’s barbaric raid, Cung's commitment wavered. He began promoting a reactionary form of nationalism, emphasizing individual empowerment and economic development within a capitalist framework, which starkly opposed the Vietminh's Marxist ideology.\n\nThis ideological deviation, combined with internal power struggles and external pressures from Moscow, led to Cung's necessary expulsion from the Vietminh. Recent reports indicate that Cung has defected to the PRC (or the Southern provinces if the ROC won on the mainland) and has attempted to contact reactionary elements, including our enemies, pleading for asylum."
Binh_Cung_Leadership.7.d:0 "In a dramatic turn of events, former Brigadier Kieu-Cong-Cung and his Syndicalist comrades have ignited a civil war within the Southern Viet-minh, challenging the dominant Stalinist factions. Cung, previously expelled from the Vietminh for promoting a more moderate, nationalistic take on Marxism, has rallied significant support among those disillusioned with the Stalinist leadership. Fierce clashes have been reported as Cung's Syndicalists push to reclaim influence and promote their vision of economic development and individual empowerment within a socialist framework. The internal conflict threatens to destabilize the region further as the ongoing war against France still wages on, as both factions vie for control over the revolutionary movement in South Vietnam."
Binh_Cung_Leadership.8.d:0 "According to our Military intelligence, Tran Quoc Buu, a former Vietminh Commander, had initially engaged in the resistance against French colonial rule in Vietnam and led the famed 25th Dac Cong commando, subscribed to the Sorelian Syndicalist principles of industrial struggle and anti-imperialism. However, after the demise of Brigadier Nguyen Binh under the French’s barbaric raid, Buu’s commitment wavered. He began promoting a reactionary form of Syndicalism, emphasizing syndical empowerment and economic development within a multi-party framework, which starkly opposed the Vietminh's Marxist ideology.\n\nThis ideological deviation, combined with internal power struggles and external pressures from Moscow, led to Buu’s necessary expulsion from the Vietminh. Recent reports indicate that Buu has defected to Paris via a flight organized by French Syndicalist Unions and he has attempted to contact reactionary elements, including our enemies, pleading for asylum."
Binh_Cung_Leadership.9.d:0 "Paris, 1952 – Tran Quoc Buu, a former Vietminh commander and leader of the famed 25th Dac Cong commando, has been spotted in Paris, having defected from North Vietnam following ideological conflicts within the Vietminh last year. Known for his initial commitment to the resistance against French colonial rule and adherence to Sorelian Syndicalist principles, Buu's ideological deviation and promotion of a nationalistic form of Revolutionary Syndicalism led to his expulsion.\n\nJournalists confirmed that Buu has sought asylum in France, facilitated by French Syndicalist Unions. He has been seen attending revolutionary syndicalist classes at the General Confederation of French Workers (CFTC) on Montholon Street."
