The French protectorate led to new development projects and education advancements. Moroccan soldiers played a major role in both World Wars for the French state. However, the French occupation also sparked a series of revolts and unrest. The Moroccan nationalist parties began emerging in the 1930s, launching a non-violent movement for independence. Hopes for independence after World War II were dashed, leading to increasing violence by nationalist activists. The Tangier Speech by Sultan Muhammad V called for decolonization and independence. The aftermath saw several massacres conducted by French forces in Casablanca. Tensions are high as Moroccans increasingly view armed resistance as the only means forward. General Alphonse Juin must decide how to maintain French control in spite of rising nationalist unrest or prepare for a dignified French exit from the region.\n\nSpanish rule in Morocco began in the early twentieth century when Spain and France divided the country into separate spheres of influence. The 1920s saw Spain embroiled in the Rif War, which they won only after suffering heavy casualties. The Spanish Civil War saw Moroccan soldiers serve Spanish dictator Francisco Franco loyally. After his victory, Franco rewarded the territory with liberal policies. Moroccan nationalist parties emerged and began publicly pushing for independence. The Tangier Speech by Sultan Muhammad V called for decolonization and independence. Although indirectly focused on the French, many Moroccans in the Spanish territory were also inspired, spurring more nationalist unrest. General Rafael Garcia Valino must decide how to mobilize local support to maintain Spanish control in the face of rising nationalist unrest or prepare for a dignified Spanish exit.§!"

 MOR_JEWISH_TT_DESC:0 "§CThe Moroccan Jewish community settled in the region for many generations. The advent of French colonialism saw many Jewish families take advantage of European institutions, especially schools. The Sultan traditionally held positive ties with the Jewish community, notably aiding them during World War II. However, the emergence of Israel and return of French colonial oversight has strained relations. Arab nationalists increasingly view Israel as a major threat and see the Moroccan Jews as a potential fifth column. They advocate the government more harshly control the Jewish community. Among Moroccan anti-colonial activists, they see the Jewish community as closely allied with the French and a threat to Moroccan independence. For the Jewish community, the French are seen increasingly as their key protectors and many now see migration as the only means for their protection. The government must decide how to calm the anxiety of Moroccan Jews or support those policies advocated by the Arab nationalists and anti-colonial advocates.§!"

 MOR_FACTION_1_DESC:0 "Led by famed anti-colonial fighter and Rift War veteran Abd el-Karim, the Liberation Committee of the Arab Maghreb established its main office in Cairo. The organization embraces Arab nationalism, advocating the unification of the Maghreb. The group is popular among young, urban intellectuals and those advocating for armed resistance to the colonial powers. They are especially popular in the areas controlled or previously influenced by Spain. Their supporters oppose local Arabs and Berbers they view as reactionary or collaborationist, such as traditional rural rulers and the royal government. For the group to grow it must not only challenge the colonial powers but also convince the people to embrace the new pan-Arabist nationalism sweeping across the Arab World."
 MOR_FACTION_2_DESC:0 "Thami El Glaoui leads the rural pashas who have increasingly shown a resistance to the nationalist parties. For decades, these pashas have thrived under French colonial rule. The French have provided autonomy and protection, allowing the pashas to consolidate their power over rural communities and accumulate personal wealth. Mobilizing their supporters will allow them to maintain their autonomy and prevent nationalist and royal influence from spreading to their areas. However, as France and Spain consider new reforms, they risk alienating the pashas. With the situation changing, Thami El Glaoui must consider how he will maintain his autonomy, by supporting one of the other factions or even seize power to preserve the power of the pashas."
 MOR_FACTION_3_DESC:0 "The French Protectorate of Morocco must deal with rising unrest among the Moroccan population. Nationalist fervor is sweeping among the people, especially among the urban, working class Arabs. However, the French can count on support from settlers and the small Jewish communities present within the protectorate. Over the previous decades, the government has established strong ties among certain rural communities through military recruitment. These soldiers played pivotal roles in recent French colonial and military conflicts. These men can be counted upon to remain loyal to preserve French rule. They wish to maintain the social and economic benefits of their loyalty."
 MOR_FACTION_4_DESC:0 "The Spanish Protectorate of Morocco faces rising nationalist unrest among the people, especially among urban Moroccan Muslims. Along with some settler populations, the Spanish can call on the minority Moroccan Jewish community. Like the French, the Spanish established strong connections with rural Moroccan communities through military recruitment. These soldiers proved immensely loyal and effective during the Spanish Civil War. Spain can count on the loyalty of these soldiers to support a continuation of Spanish rule in order to preserve their relative independence and monetary support."
 MOR_FACTION_5_DESC:0 "In the Tangier Speech, Sultan Muhammad V explicitly stated his support for Moroccan independence. He is working closely with Allal al-Fassi and his nationalist Istiqlal Party. The party is popular among urban Arab and Berbers. The faction also enjoys support from traditional Moroccan rulers who have pledged loyalty to the royal family for many generations. With its strong local ties and international legitimacy, the Sultan must decide on how to balance his approach to other Moroccan factions and the colonial regimes. Moving for independence too abruptly could provoke negative consequences, but remaining idle during this moment of anti-colonial fervor may leave them struggling to control the destiny of the Moroccan nation."

The advent of French colonialism saw many Jewish families take advantage of European institutions, especially schools. The Sultan traditionally held positive ties with the Jewish community, notably aiding them during World War II. However, the emergence of Israel and return of French colonial oversight has strained relations. Arab nationalists increasingly view Israel as a major threat and see the Moroccan Jews as a potential fifth column. They advocate the government more harshly control the Jewish community. Among Moroccan anti-colonial activists, they see the Jewish community as closely allied with the French and a threat to Moroccan independence. For the Jewish community, the French are seen increasingly as their key protectors and many now see migration as the only means for their protection. The government must decide how to calm the anxiety of Moroccan Jews or support those policies advocated by the Arab nationalists and anti-colonial advocates."

Thousands lined up on the doors of the Royal Palace, awaiting impatiently for the King's body to be taken to his grave, to the ballads echoing and the smell of incense that mark the end of an era. The memory of independence seems to have never been so fresh.And whispers of assassination spread like wildfire."

While discussing ties with the West, two men from the crowd threw three Molotov cocktails at the prince and his security. The first Molotov missed entirely, giving alertness to the two coming. One hit security while the third never even was thrown as the crowd quickly swarmed the men. Hassan II finished his speech before quickly being escorted to safety. The two men and three other accomplishes have been found and arrested.\n Crown Prince Hassan II was quick to thank the guards and his supporters in the crowd for saving his life, promising that this will not stop future events. What could of ended in a horrific murder left none injured and opposition of the regime weakening in influence."
 morocco_news.1.d.alt:0 "Devastating news of the prince's death that has spread across Morocco has been officially confirmed by state authorities this evening. Due to his father's declining health, Crown Prince Hassan II began to take up many of his father's roles by the end of the decade, leading to him making more public appearances. One such appearance in the city of Rabat would be his last as he addressed the nation on improving relations with the United States and the West. After calling for friendly ties with Israel, three Molotov cocktails would be thrown into Hassan II and his security. Frontline guards would be shocked by the first Molotov, giving a gap for a second to hit Hassan directly on the head, following a third on the chest. The Prince would ignite on fire and collapse, hitting his head during the fall. He would quickly be extinguished and rushed for medical treatment as marshal law was enforced over the frenzied city. Five suspected terrorists were captured within the first hour.\n With Hassan II confirmed dead, the fate of Morocco is at a crossroads. As the current king grows ill, the need for a replacement heir has grown urgent. Next in line for succession is Hassan II's brother Prince Moulay Abdallah, who has shown little interest in politics. Without the strong Hassan II as a replacement for Mohammad V, this may signal a grave future for the Alaouite Dynasty."

 casablanca.1.d:0 "In the sprawling port city of Casablanca within the arid deserts of Morocco, the leaders of various North African nations, such as Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Morocco, and others have decided to end their conflict and animosity between their nations and create the \"Casablanca Group\". Formed as an informal association of African nations, its sole purpose was to unite Africa under one banner, with Pan-Africanism a core tenant in its values for a new, united Africa. While the Casablanca Group is widely seen as a benevolent organization, critics point out that the organization is mostly comprising of radical, left wing leaders and their respective political parties, with viewpoints that are critical to Western rule in Africa. Nevertheless, observers believe that the organization may bring about lasting peace and prosperity in one of the most violent, most impoverished continents on the planet, but it is too early to be certain."

When the Resident-General stepped into his car and his chauffer started it, the Citroen Traction Avant burst into flames, killing both of them and singing the leaves of the nearby flora. Samir Toufiq, a previously unknown Moroccan Nationalist, has claimed responsibility for the sudden attack, crying out for the Moroccan people to rise up against their French oppressors as he was arrested this afternoon. Toufiq's call to action has taken hold in many Moroccans, who are now marching the streets of Rabat tonight in protest of the imperialist French government. Though this event was notably violent, it has roused the people of Morocco to take action for independence."
