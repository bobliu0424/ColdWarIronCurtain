 ENG_battle_hull_medium_1:0 "Vanguard Class Refit"
 ENG_battle_hull_medium_0_desc:0 "HMS Vanguard was a British fast battleship built during the Second World War and commissioned after the war ended. She was the biggest and fastest of the Royal Navy's battleships, the only ship of her class, and the last battleship to be built."
 ENG_battle_hull_medium_1_desc:0 "A sort of what if HMS Vanguard had recieved the same scale and amount of refitting as the US Navy Iowa class ships recieved. HMS Vanguard did recieve a brief refit in in 1955 before being sold for scarp and being broken up in 1960. But what if that had not been the case?"

 ENG_carrier_hull_3:0 "Audacious Class Refit"
 ENG_carrier_hull_4:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
 ENG_carrier_hull_0_desc:0 "The Implacable-class aircraft carrier consisted of two aircraft carriers built for the Royal Navy during World War II. Derived from the design of the Illustrious class, they were faster and carried more aircraft than the older ships. They were initially assigned to the Home Fleet when completed in 1944 and attacked targets in Norway as well as the German battleship Tirpitz. Subsequently, they were assigned to the British Pacific Fleet (BPF)."
 ENG_carrier_hull_1_desc:0 "The Audacious-class aircraft carriers were a class of aircraft carriers proposed by the British government in the 1930s - 1940s and completed after the Second World War. The two ships built were heavily modified and diverged over their service lives."
 ENG_carrier_hull_2_desc:0 "CVA-01 was a proposed United Kingdom aircraft carrier, designed during the 1960s. The ship was intended to be the first of a class that would replace all then-existing Royal Navy carriers, most of which had been designed before or during the Second World War."
 ENG_carrier_hull_3_desc:0 "As the builds of Audacious (renamed Eagle) and Irresistible (renamed Ark Royal) progressed they differed so much that they effectively became the lead (and sole) ships of each of their own classes. They formed the backbone of the postwar carrier fleet, and were much modified."

 ENG_carrier_hull_light_3:0 "Ocean Class"
 ENG_carrier_hull_light_4:0 "Invincible Class Refit"
 ENG_carrier_hull_light_0_desc:0 "The 1942 Design Light Fleet Carrier, commonly referred to as the British Light Fleet Carrier, was a light aircraft carrier design created by the Royal Navy during the Second World War, and used by eight naval forces between 1944 and 2001. They were designed and constructed by civilian shipyards to serve as an intermediate step between the expensive, full-size fleet aircraft carriers and the less expensive but limited-capability escort carriers."
 ENG_carrier_hull_light_1_desc:0 "The Centaur class of aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy was the last of the light fleet carrier designs started during the closing years of World War II. The first ship of the original four in the class was commissioned in 1953 and the final decommissioned in 1984. The first three ships lacked an angled flight deck and were therefore unsuitable for fast jet aircraft, and production of a second batch of four carriers was cancelled."
 ENG_carrier_hull_light_2_desc:0 "The Invincible class was a class of light aircraft carrier operated by the Royal Navy. The vessels were built as aviation-capable anti-submarine warfare (ASW) platforms to counter the Cold War North Atlantic Soviet submarine threat, and initially embarked Sea Harrier aircraft and Sea King HAS.1 anti-submarine helicopters."
 ENG_carrier_hull_light_3_desc:0 "HMS Ocean was a Landing Platform Helicopter, formerly the UK's helicopter carrier and the fleet flagship of the Royal Navy. She was designed to support amphibious landing operations and to support the staff of Commander UK Amphibious Force and Commander UK Landing Force."
 ENG_carrier_hull_light_4_desc:0 "In mid-2000s, the Invincible Class ships underwent a further refit at Rosyth Dockyard. This refit involved the total rebuild of the ski jump, the adding of better communications and reconfiguring the ship so that it can be more quickly switched between the light aircraft carrier and helicopter carrier roles."

 ENG_screen_hull_medium_1_desc:0 "The Type 12 or Whitby-class frigates were a six-ship class of anti-submarine frigates of the Royal Navy, which entered service late in the 1950s. They were designed in the early 1950s as first-rate ocean-going convoy escorts, in the light of experience gained during World War II. At this time, the Royal Navy were designing single-role escorts and the Whitbys were designed as fast convoy escorts capable of tackling high-speed submarines. "
 ENG_screen_hull_medium_2:0 "Amazon Class"
 ENG_screen_hull_medium_2_short:0 "Type 21"
 ENG_screen_hull_medium_2_desc:0 "In the mid-1960s, the Royal Navy (RN) had a requirement for a replacement for the diesel-powered Leopard-class (Type 41) and Salisbury-class (Type 61) frigates. While the Royal Navy's warships were traditionally designed by the Ministry of Defence's Ship Department based at Bath, private shipyards (in particular Vosper Thorneycroft) campaigned for the right to design and build a ship to meet this requirement. Vospers claimed that, by ignoring what they claimed to be the conservative design practices followed by the MoD team at Bath, they could deliver the new frigate at a significantly lower price."

 ENG_screen_hull_medium_4_desc:0 "The Type 23 frigate or Duke class is a class of frigates built for the United Kingdom's Royal Navy. The ships are named after British Dukes, thus leading to the class being commonly known as the Duke class."

 ENG_screen_hull_heavy_0:0 "Daring Class"
 ENG_screen_hull_heavy_0_desc:0 "The Daring-class ships were both the largest and most heavily armed ships serving in Commonwealth navies to be classified as destroyers. They were intended to fill some of the duties of cruisers, which post WW2 were considered both expensive and obsolete by naval planners, and were briefly officially considered a hybrid type (Darings) before being rated as destroyers. They were also the last destroyers of the RN and RAN to possess guns as their main armament (instead of guided missiles), which saw use during the Indonesian Confrontation and the Vietnam War."
 ENG_screen_hull_heavy_1:0 "County Class"
 ENG_screen_hull_heavy_1_desc:0 "The County class was a class of British guided missile destroyers, the first such warships built by the Royal Navy.

 ENG_battle_hull_light_1:0 "Tiger Class"
 ENG_battle_hull_light_1_desc:0 "The Tiger class were a class of three British warships of the 20th century and the last all-gun cruisers of the Royal Navy. Construction as Minotaur-class cruisers began during World War II but due to post-war austerity, the Korean War and Churchill favouring nuclear weapons and aircraft over the surface fleet, the hulls remained unfinished."
 ENG_battle_hull_light_2:0 "Tiger Class Refit"
 ENG_battle_hull_light_2_desc:0 "By 1964 the Conservative Government and half the naval staff saw the Tigers as no longer affordable or credible in the surface combat or fleet air defence role and would have preferred to decommission them but given they were technically only three years old and built at immense expense, scrapping them was politically difficult. They approved conversion into helicopter carriers; carrying Westland Wessex helicopters for Royal Marine Commando operations. A large hangar replaced the 'Y' turret, the forward turrets were retained for gunfire support and anti-surface work."
 ENG_battle_hull_light_3:0 "Bristol Class"
 ENG_battle_hull_light_3_short:0 "Type 82"
 ENG_battle_hull_light_3_desc:0 "The Type 82 or Bristol-class destroyer was to have been a class of eight Royal Navy guided missile destroyers mounting the Sea Dart missile, intended to replace the Seaslug-armed County-class destroyers. They would provide area air-defence over carrier task forces and could serve independently in the modern cruiser role East of Suez. With long range air, surface and anti-submarine missile capability and would also serve in a group of four Type 82s and four "Broad Beam" Leander-class frigates as outer and inner escorts to the planned CVA-01 aircraft carriers.
