 USA_70s_flavor.1.d:0 "The popular ‘reverse murder mystery’ detective drama Columbo recently ended its third season and has been renewed for a fourth. While it remains very popular in the US, it is a sensation overseas. The frumpy cigar-smoking lieutenant has quite the reputation in Romania, since it is one of the few western television shows allowed to air in the country. In fact, so dedicated are its Romanian fans that the communist government fears unrest if the people start to believe that Columbo will end broadcasting or that the government will fail to renew the license to air the show. The last few episodes have yet to air in the country.\n\nThey are so concerned that they have reached out to the State Department, with a request that we ask Lt. Columbo’s actor Peter Falk to film a message to the Romanian people. A draft has already been prepared that reassures them that more episodes are on the way this fall, and that Columbo will not leave the screens of Romanian TV, at least for another year. The message will be appended to the last episode when it airs in Romania sometime this May. The State Department is supportive of the idea and sees it as an easy public affairs win. More importantly, we get to exercise some soft-power over the eastern bloc."

 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.0.d:0 "Today, the United States Supreme Court released a ruling in the case of United States v. Louisiana, a case involving the jurisdiction of offshore oil and petroleum deposits. In this, the federal government sued the Louisiana state government for not recognizing the right of the federal government to use that land and continuing to trespass on it. The Court ruled that the federal government has paramount rights over the territory and oil rights and that Louisiana, much like the state of California in a similar suit from three years prior, has no rights to oil and petroleum in a submerged area. Not expected to sit well with states’ rights advocates, this ruling continues to emphasize the supremacy of the federal government."
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.0a.d:0 "Today, the Submerged Lands Act was passed by the US Congress. Meant to soothe states’ rights advocates angered by the Supreme Court ruling in US v. Louisiana, this Act reverts oil and gas rights back to individual states with coastal borders, up to 3 nautical miles from the coastline. This bill is particularly controversial, as many federal government advocates argue that the federal government should have full control over all oil and gas rights within its borders. Will we sign it or veto this bill?"
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.10.d:0 "Today at the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Northern members of the party staged a walkout, after Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia was nominated overwhelmingly by his fellow Southern Democrats. Faced with extremely strong opposition to their proposed civil rights plank, the Northern faction is forced to form a third party convention, likely to be held in Minneapolis, in the coming weeks."
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.11.d:0 "Today at the 1952 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the Southern members of the party staged a walkout, after several losses in the rules committee over a proposed loyalty oath pushed by the Northern Coalition of the Kefauver and Harriman campaigns in response to the 1948 Southern walkout. Angered by proposed additions of civil rights and other progressive policies to the national Democratic party platform, the Southern faction is forced to form a third party convention, likely to be held in Montgomery, Alabama, in the coming weeks."
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.12.d:0 "After their walkout of the national Party Convention in Chicago due to the nomination of segregationist Senator Richard Russell, the Northern liberal faction of the party assembled in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to nominate a candidate. Angered because of segregationist Southern Democrats attempting to hijack national politics with their racist and regional interests, the Northern faction split off, deciding to nominate their own liberal candidates. Composed of the Northern faction of the national Democratic Party such as the Minnesota Democratic Farmer-Labor Party (DFLP), the North Dakota Nonpartisan League as well as the New York Liberal Party. As expected, the convention nominated Senator Herbert Lehman of New York to head the presidential ticket and Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota for the Vice Presidency."
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.13.d:0 "After their walkout of the national Party Convention in Chicago, the Southern faction has assembled in Montgomery, Alabama, to nominate their candidate. Angered because of progressive policies such as increased civil rights and desegregation being proposed by Northern Democrats, the Southern faction split off, deciding to nominate their own candidate to represent their constituents' interests. Composed of the now renamed States Rights Democratic Party, they are expected to nominate Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Governor Allan Shivers of Texas to their presidential ticket."

 Campaign_Report.2.d:0 "As the Democratic National Convention convenes, fears of a encore of the issues that plagued the 1948 convention have come out into the open as growing tensions between liberal and dixiecrat have begin to heat up, and like 1948, Democratic party faithful fear yet another walkout thay may rock the party establishment for a second time, only this time, it might not only be from one side of the isle.\n\nIt all started with the DNC Subcommittee on Credentials, where debates among hardline dixiecrats and firebrand liberals have reached a fever pitch, with ether side militant in their desire to be seated as delegates for the presidential deliberation.\n\nIt is from this mudslinging between party hardliners that saw the formation of the so-called "Northern Coalition" a power bloc formed by populist candidate Estes Kefauver with support of William Harriman and the liberals, all of whom are furious at the party establishments refusal to un-seat the dixiecrats from the convention.\n\nWith the prospect of the Dixiecrats staging a walkout as they did in 1948 already a very real possibility, the sudden potential for the left wing of the party to do the exact same thing in opposite, should the debate over seating turn sour, poses an equally disruptive threat to the Demcratic party platform."
 Campaign_Report.3.d:0 "It is no surprise that the dedicated animosity of the conservative and liberal sides of the Democratic Party have come to butt heads yet again, and it might well explain a new development on the increasingly inflexible stance of the liberal side of the aisle; a proposal by the Northern Coalition to the Dixiecrats, one that might be, as some worry, an ultimatum that could tear the party apart.\n\nOriginally a challenge posed by former Texas Congressman Maury Maverick, the Northern Coalition of liberal-minded Democrats; Kefauver, Harriman, Maverick, among others, angered by the continued obstinacy of southern conservatives, have collectively demanded a loyalty pledge by the Dixiecrats to put their contempt aside and unilaterally support the party's nominations for White House.\n\nWhile it is not yet known if the Dixiecrats will knuckle under in the name of party solidarity, nonetheless, this comes as a real eye-opener as to just how divided the party has become; while the Democrats are no stranger to infighting, this overture by the Coalition might solidify ideological boundaries beyond compromise, and sets the stage for a possible upset in the selection of the party nominee."
 Campaign_Report.4.d:0 "Despite repeated attempts to convince the party establishment otherwise, the venerable liberal darling of the DNC, Adlai Stevenson, seen by many as the natural successor to the New Deal legacies of Roosevelt and Truman, is seemingly ready for the support of the party's bid for the White House.\n\nPossessing a humility and honesty that is exceedingly rare among politicians, Stevenson had planned, and insisted, on running for reelection for Governor of Illinois, carrying forward his reputation as a hardliner against corruption into a new term at the convention.\n\nWith his trademark sense of humble, self-deprecating humor, yet another trait uncommon amongst politicians, Stevenson finally flipped at the insistence of establishment party members, Harry Truman among others, and accepted the party's wishes to put forth his name on the ballot.\n\nThe Democratic Party's particular affection for Stevenson rubs their Republican colleagues the wrong way, with some in the RNC, and even a few working-class Democrats, deriding Stevenson as an indecisive big-wig; regardless, Stevenson's popularity in all corners of the convention shows immense promise as a candidate for nomination."
 Campaign_Report.5.d:0 "Sitting increasingly at the forefront of American discourse, both as a national polity and a cultural fulcrum point, the growing anger at the continued institution of the Jim Crow Laws, in addition to the impenetrability of not-white Americans to prosper in the current climate, has overtaken the inter-party dialogue within the Democratic National Convention.\n\nNot wanting to spark another Dixiecrat Walkout as happened in '48", incumbent President Harry Truman has been more than careful to address the issue of Civil Rights with a more deft touch, formulating a platform that did not call for the support of a Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC), but rather focused an attack on the infamous Senate Rule 22, drafting a plan for changes in congressional procedures to ensure faster voting, a means by which to prevent any Dixiecrat from filibustering any civil rights legislation they might try to pass down the line.\n\nMeanwhile, arguments from the left and right side of the legislature continue to mount; the convention saw senators Herbert Lehman of New York and John Sparkman of Alabama clash, the former announcing to the press his intention to fully commit to the cause of Civil Rights, the latter, despite his own personal antipathy for the Dixiecrats, maintaining a hardline states' rights stance.\n\nIf any sort of consensus for the nomination for President is to be attained, some sort of solution to the Civil Rights question must be found, lest the party fall further into even more intense infighting. "
 Campaign_Report.6.d:0 "The Democratic National Convention, after a long period of deliberations and party infighting, has finally reached a conclusion, and Democratic Party have, at last, come to an agreement on the party nomination for President.\n\nParty faithful have placed the name of senator Estes Kefauver on the presidential ballot; stalwarts of the Northern Coalition are exultant, while conservative Dixiecrats are incensed, onlookers cheered as the Tennessee firebrand took the stage to graciously and proudly accept the party nomination.\n\nRepublican opposition is horrified to see another southern populist with ambitions for the Oval Office, and between Kefauver's glowing reputation for combating corruption and a markedly liberal stance on Civil Rights, many fear the potential for Kefauver to be the second coming of Huey Long,\n\nComparisons to the late Kingfish aside, it is clear that antipathy for Jim Crow is starting to squeeze the Party's leadership, and if Kefauver is as seemingly progressive as he appears, a Kefauver presidency might well see a wide number of issues, including the Segregation question, come to the fore.\n\nHow a candidate like Kefauver would conduct himself as the Commander-in-Chief in the greater theater of the Cold War remains to be seen."
 Campaign_Report.7.d:0 "Another name has thrown their hat into the ring of the upcoming presidential primaries, this in the form of senator Estes Kefauver, who has announced his campaign for the Democratic Party Nominee.\n\nA native of Tennessee, Kefauver is celebrated as a defiant liberal, as well as for his reputation for his trust-busting and anti-corruption initiatives, making him a rare progressive in a state otherwise dominated by Dixiecrat conservatives.\n\nKefauver has been quick to tie his campaign image to that of the old time American frontier, appearing in public wearing a Daniel Boone-inspired Coonskin Cap, and even campaigning to various Appalachian communities via dogsled.\n\nIt remains to be seen how far Kefauver will go in the campaign; with Dixiecrats angered by his moderate support of Civil Rights, while establishment democrats, including Harry Truman in particular, view him as populist who runs the risk of splintering the party ranks.\n\nWith the Democratic National Convention in the distance, time will tell if Kefauver's campaign will resonate with voting population."
 Campaign_Report.8.d:0 "The primary election for the Democratic Party has seem a rather surprising development in the upcoming presidential race; only a few months after President Truman's announcement that he would not seek a second term in political office, the sitting Vice President of the United States, veteran statesman Alben Barkley, with the backing of a cadre of D.C based Democrats, has formally announced his campaign for the White House.\n\nHaving served as a politician since 1912, Barkley has been an outspoken liberal even through the tumult of the two world wars, and despite being in his mid 70s with multiple reported health issues, few would argue that the grey eminence from Kentucky does not have the experience necessary for the office of the President.\n\nThis is not to say all within the party are enthusiastic about Barkley or his chances within the party; even though he has the support of Harry Truman and a wide range of party faithful, many labor democrats are concerned that Barkley's advanced age makes him ineligible for office, and with the likes of Richard Russel and Estes Kefauver already in the race, few are convinced of Barkley's chances at the ballot box.\n\nWhile it remains unknown whether the Democratic Party will rally to Barkley come the National Convention, the Vice President has clearly shown an energetic committal to the campaign, and with the potential backing of Washington combined with that of the President, Barkley's run in the primaries carries the chance for an upset."
 Campaign_Report.9.d:0 "After a hotly contested convention, the Democratic Party have decided the platforming of a candidate for the Oval Office in the 1952 election, and despite the fury of a number of party delegates, the party is more or less united in the confirmation of the party's nominee.\n\nThe sitting Vice President Alben Barkley, a stalwart of the party for almost four decades, has secured the necessary backing to solidify his run for the White House; labor democrats remain belligerent in light of Barkley's age, while the Dixiecrats and the Northern Coalition are skeptical of his potential performance in the coming campaign.\n\nThe DNC crowd welcomed the elderly Barkley with a round of applause; the vice president thanked the members of the party for his nomination, which many had previously considered a longshot, and promised to carry forward the principles of liberty that presidents Truman, Roosevelt and Wilson had held before him, firm in the belief, having watched the United States of America survive the harrowing years of two world wars, that the American people could survive the coming struggle with their heads held high.\n\nThe Vice President's proclamations, considered naïve by some at the convention, may well prove a challenging standard to live up to under the ever-present of the threat of the Cold War, something the Barkley will be forced to confront should he emerge victorious in November."
 Campaign_Report.10.d:0 "Interparty deliberations at the Democratic National Convention, after a week of intense arguments among party hardliners, have finally agreed on a cannidate for the White House.\n\nSeen by some a compromise candidate, and by others as the logical option, Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson, practically coronated by Truman and his supporters as the heir to continue Roosevelt's New Deal, has been confirmed by the DNC as the presidential nominee.\n\nSpeaking to a raucous crowd, with his trademark sense of humanity and compassion on full display, democratic candidate Stevenson urged unity, not just within the party, but the country abroad, citing the uncertainty of the times, in the name of a brighter future.\n\n"When the tumult and shouting die, when the bands are gone and the lights are dimmed, there is the stark reality of responsibility in an hour of history haunted with those gaunt, grim specters of strife, dissension, and materialism at home, and ruthless, inscrutable, and hostile power abroad. The ordeal of the twentieth century, the bloody and most turbulent era in the whole Christian age, is far from over. Sacrifice, patience, understanding,  and implacable purpose may be our lot for years to come. Let's face it; let's talk sense to the American people, let's tell them the truth, that there are no pains without gains, That we are on the eve of great decisions!"\n\nIn spite of of the past week of rivalry between conservatives and liberals, the party is now, at least for the time being, united in a common effort, and fully committed to the upcoming election in November."

 Primary_Season.1.d:0 "As the decade of the Second World War fades into memory, and the United States enters into the commercial revolution and newfound prosperity of the Atomic Era, incumbent president Harry Truman, once the son of a Missouri haberdasher, now the leader of the world's first Nuclear Power, faces an uphill battle in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nDespite his victories in the Second World War, the heir to Franklin Roosevelt's office hasn't accomplished much to engender himself to the post-war American electorate, much as Truman himself once glumly predicted; growing antipathy from southern conservatives has kept much of Truman's attempts at reform in stagnation, and they will likely oppose his campaign with equal vigor, leading the President conflicted as to run for a second term.\n\nIn addition, positioning from the opposing party has begun to heat up as election season nears; republican progeny Robert Taft has already announced his campaign for the Oval Office, opposite to this, the growing popularity of the Draft Eisenhower movement seeks the support of the celebrated war hero to accept the Republican ticket for the presidency.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Truman will attempt to run for office with the campaign seemingly stacked against him, nonetheless, it is clear that whoever is sworn into office in January, it will have long running implications for the balance of the Cold War."
 Primary_Season.1a.d:0 "As the decade of the Second World War fades into memory, and the United States enters into the commercial revolution and newfound prosperity of the Atomic Era, interim president Alban Barkley, the successor to the successor of FDR, might not remain in office long enough to see it.\n\nStill reeling from the resignation of Harry Truman, the former vice president now sees the decisions of his former superior coming back to haunt him; anger over Douglas MacArthur's dismissal has propelled the legendary Field Marshal to the forefront of the Republican Party, the champion of Corregidor, icon of the Pacific War and arch-nemesis of the late Franklin Roosevelt, now with the backing of Robert Taft and Joseph McCarthy, imminently seeks the Oval Office.\n\nModerates and liberals of the Republican Party are horrified by the prospect of the the American Caesar in the White House, and are already scrambling for candidates to run opposition campaigns; Thomas Dewey, Harold Stassen, Earl Warren, all names bandied about in a desperate effort to counter MacArthur's power bloc of the HUAC and old money conservatives.\n\nMeanwhile, President Barkley remains undecided as whether to even run for a second term, and the Democrats are just as panic stricken as anyone across the aisle as how to respond to MacArthur's campaign, some even considering approaching MacArthur's former protégé, fellow general and war hero Dwight Eisenhower, to accept a bid for the Democratic Party nomination.\n\nWith the current balance of the Cold War at such a delicate stage, the upcoming election might well prove the most pivotal in American history."
 Primary_Season.1b.d:0 "As the decade of the Second World War fades into memory, and the United States enters into the commercial revolution and newfound prosperity of the Atomic Era, interim president Alban Barkley, the successor to the successor of FDR, has more than a lot on his plate for the campaign season.\n\nWith the nation still in mourning after the death of president Harry Truman to Puerto Rican nationalists, the former-vice president Barkley now has the unenviable task of picking up the pieces of Truman's already turbulent administration, carrying forward the late president's attempts to promote integration and welfare expansion in an electorate increasingly hostile to ether.\n\nIn the midst of this, the Republican Party is already on the move to contest the Oval Office in November; the moderate conservatives of the Draft Eisenhower movement seeks the support of the venerable General accept the bid for White House, meanwhile, RNC hardliners flock to the banner of presidential heir apparent Robert Taft, who now rallies the party establishment to his campaign in the hopes of countering Eisenhower.\n\nAs it stands, projections for Alban Barkly's campaign look grim, and with the Labor wing of DNC worried about his advanced age, the president himself remains conflicted as to run for a second term at all.\n\nWith an ideological war still raging in Europe and elsewhere, the final vote tally in November might well prove transformative in the United States' conduct in the Cold War. "

 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.1.d:0 "Senator Estes Kefauver has formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, one that would go against current Democratic president Harry S. Truman should he choose to run for a re-election. Although a freshman Senator, Kefauver has already attracted nationwide attention as Chairman of the Special Committee to Investigate Organised Crime in Insterstate Commerce. While the Senator had consistently supported Truman's domestic and foreign policies , it was generally believed that his hearings on organised crime had embarrassed the President, largely because several prominent Democrats had been implicated by the committee's findings. In addition to announcing his candidacy Kefauver stated his intention of competing in most of the forthcoming presidential primaries. Since the first of the nation's primaries would be held in New Hampshire, it seems likely that this contest will determine whether the Senator will emerge as a viable presidential contender or will be dismissed as a mere protest candidate."
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.2.d:0 "Senator Richard B. Russell has formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. Russell, responding to questions from newsmen after completing his formal statement, firmly declined to say whether he would support President Harry S. Truman if the latter were re-nominated at the next Democratic National Convention. Some years earlier Russell had allowed his name to be submitted as a presidential candidate at the Democratic National Convention, in Philadelphia. At that time the Senator's candidacy had been primarily a gesture of protest against the inclusion of a strong civil rights plank. Despite overwhelming support from Southern delegates at the convention, Russell had been easily defeated by Truman for the presidential nomination. However, he remained loyal to the Democratic Party and refused to support an independent states-rights ticket.\n\nGenerally acknowledged as the leader of a conservative bloc of Senate Democrats, Russell, in the years after the previous Presidential campaign, has vigorously opposed many of the President's key domestic legislative proposals. He was also Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, which presided over a Senate investigation of the controversial dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur.\n\nIt appears that current President Harry S. Truman will have quite the opposition, should he choose to rerun for the Democratic Presidential primaries."
 DEM_1952_PRIMARY.3.d:0 "President Truman, who had already served the United States of America for two terms, has decided to drop his campaign for a third term. This decision was taken after President Truman lost the presidential primary of New Hampshire to Estes Kefauver. Reporters have attributed his loss of the primary to a large decrease of his popularity, various economic problems that weren't solved by his administration and divisions within the Democratic Party that could have impeded the advance of the president's legislative agenda, despite the Democratic Party's control of Congress. President Truman has also been quoted as saying that he considers primaries as an "eyewash", potentially alienating voters with his dismissive remarks.\n\nKefauver's victory has been attributed to the intensive campaign he waged in New Hampshire, where instead of criticising the Truman administration, he stressed his own congressional voting record and his concern over crime and governmental corruption. Notwithstanding that Kefauver is a respected member of the United States Senate and a tireless campaigner, few observers predicted that he would make a creditable showing in the New Hampshire primary. Inasmuch as every major Democratic politician was active in behalf of the President, it was considered quite unlikely that the junior senator from Tennessee would attract more than token support among the New Hampshire electorate.\n\nThe first election returns indicated a surprisingly close race between Truman and Kefauver. By the following morning Kefauver had compiled a lead over the President."

 Formosa_Resolution.1.d:0 "The United States Senate passed a joint-resolution called the Formosa Resolution. It states that the President has the authority, at his discretion, to deploy the United States military to secure and protect Formosa (Taiwan) and its surrounding islands in response to any armed attacks by communists. The resolution is being celebrated across Taiwan as its people have long felt the threat of a mainland communist attack. The Taiwanese government pledged to remain steadfast in its defiance of the communists and thanked America for standing with the forces for a democratic China. The Peoples Republic of China condemned the resolution as the first step of America trying to turn Formosa into a colony and imperialist base to attack the revolution. Many Americans support the resolution as demonstrating the commitment of the United States to defend the global community from communism."
nixon_native.1.d:0 "In a recent address to Congress, President Nixon unveiled his policy of Native Self Determination. The President condemned previous policy and called for the government to allow Native Americans to control their own future. In the upcoming months, Congress is expected to pass a series of bills to support the establishment of self-governing tribal communities with American support. This represents a reversal in the American policy of termination. Previous Presidents supported the termination policy which sought to integrate Native Americans and end all self-governing institutions. Native Americans largely condemned termination as eradicating Native identity. The new Nixon policy is being widely praised by Native activists and leaders."
Great_Realiagnment.1.d:0 "As President Earl Warren ends his second term in office, the nation reflects on the major political changes sweeping the nation. The success of Warren has strengthened the moderate and liberal wings of the Republican Party. The embrace of civil rights rekindled the traditional ties between the Republican Party and the African American community. More urban Americans are also embracing the Republican Party as a bastion of stability and equality. For the Democratic Party, it saw opportunities to make inroads with liberal communities fail. As such, the party now increasingly embraces the conservative vision of the Dixiecrats. The Democratic Party increasingly appears attractive to the more conservative and rural populations, especially in the South and Midwest. Many pundits believe this impact of President Warren will permanently shift the political trajectory of the two major American political parties."
 Fat_Fucker.1.d:0 "The CIA director, Secretary of State, and top Agency operatives have developed a plan called Project FF, or Project Fat Fucker. The United States recognizes the current political organization in Egypt is unstable and heavily corrupt. If things continue, there is a high risk of a leftist revolution in the country. The plan calls for the CIA to approach King Farouk and put heavy pressure on him to initiate crucial reforms. Ultimately the goal is for the King to reform his government, spread royal authority to efficient ministers, curb corruption and offer a progressive vision for the Egyptian people. If the King refuses to change, then alternatives to his government must be considered, such as the Free Officers, a clandestine movement within armed forces of anti-royal officers interested in establishing a new, nationalist state."
Fat_Fucker.2.d:0 "The United States has approached the King and offered a dire warning. They claim if the current political situation continues, Egypt risks unrest and the overthrow of the monarchy. The Americans are insisting the King implement reforms, curb corruption, and assert his authority over the government. The reforms include giving royal authority to officials and military officers. The Americans essentially want the King to cut ties with some of his close friends, curtail some of his extracurricular interests, and establish a more progressive royal government under the guidance of trained bureaucrats and military officers. The King must decide to accept this pressure and risk his throne to foreign and domestic influence, or stay the course and maintain Egyptian sovereignty."
Fat_Fucker.3.d:0 "The King has acquiesced to American pressure on instituting critical reforms to his government and administration in order to prevent potential unrest or even uprisings. Close advisors to the King are drawing up the relevant orders and bringing in senior civil service and military officers for more prominent roles in the regime. However, although the King has agreed, it remains to be seen how deeply he will remain committed to these reforms. Regardless, the King claims he is acting in the best interests of the Egyptian people and the monarchy. Although the government media is publicizing a new initiative conceived by the King, there are already rumors across Egypt that the King is acting under American pressure. It appears some palace officials, conscious that the reforms will spell their decline, are openly spreading the word."
Fat_Fucker.4.d:0 "Project FF appears to be well on its way to success as King Farouk has indicated a willingness to agree with reforms. However, it is not the first time he has promised reforms but balked to go all the way. Regardless, the CIA and State Department are happy that the King was willing to accept our proposals in principle. The next stage will be to continue pressuring King Farouk until he implements all the reforms and establishes a secure, anti-communist, Egyptian state. Intelligence analysts argue we must continue the pressure on the King. There are fears however, that as word spreads that the King has agreed on reforms, which include giving more power to military officers, anti-royal nationalists in the military, may see this as an opportunity for their own agendas."
Fat_Fucker.5.d:0 "Our efforts to pressure King Farouk into initiating crucial reforms has failed. The King remains steadfast in his own delusions of grandeur and believes our advice is a ploy to establish American dominance in the country. Operation Ff appears to have failed to persuade the King, however, the objective to establish a strong, anti-communist Egyptian regime has not. The CIA has contacts with a group of nationalist, anti-royal military officers called the Free Officers. We can provide this group clandestine support and ensure their protection from counter-coups once they act against King Farouk. The President has directed the State Department and CIA to refocus its efforts on supporting the Free Officers to ensure when King Farouk inevitably falls, he will not be replaced by a leftist, pro-Moscow regime."
Project_FF.1.d:0 "The CIA has initiated an operation to spread information to the international press emphasizing the danger King Farouk of Egypt poses to the middle east. There are an increasing number of reports on Egypt discussing their desire to destroy Israel and rival Arab powers by any means necessary. Congressional allies, among other sources, have "leaked" specially curated intelligence reports suggesting Egypt is preparing to go bankrupt to acquire arms in order to launch attacks against neighboring states. Our agents in Egypt are spreading pamphlets and articles denouncing the corruption and moral bankruptcy of King Farouk in order to undermine his domestic base."
Project_FF.2.d:0 "There is increasing alarm across the United States and Europe over intelligence reports suggesting King Farouk of Egypt is preparing to launch military attacks against Israel and other neighboring states. The reports emphasize the delusional nature of Farouk and suggest he will take Egypt to bankruptcy in order to rapidly acquire arms to achieve his ambitions. Many American officials and their allies abroad note such a scenario is likely and renewed conflict in the region could result in a catastrophic humanitarian crisis. The Egyptian government denounces the accusations, accusing the West of launching a propaganda campaign against the Arab people."
US_Navy50s.1.d:0 "The United States Navy has held a series of high-level talks among senior officers and national defense leaders to articulate a more modern, proactive doctrine. The United States Navy believes it must deploy fleets across the oceans and position forces that can quickly arrive on the scene of any emerging international crisis. This will enable the United States more international maneuverability as it can quickly establish a forward presence and force projection. To better enact such a strategy, the Navy will required continued and extensive financial support from the government."
CIA_DOM_50s.1.d:0 "The CIA does not have domestic policing powers and is forbidden from spying on Americans at home. However, it does have a National Resources Division with a domestic focus. The NRD oversees several programs for voluntary debriefings of Americans in order to collect public intelligence and the Office of Current Intelligence which gives high-level briefings. However, the agency is rumored to be involved in other operations meant to experiment certain technologies, theories and efforts at influence public opinion. Such operations are critical in strengthening the capabilities of the agency in coming years, but the CIA plans on keeping its operations away from the public to avoid legal challenges."
CIA_DOM_50s.2.d:0 "Near the end of the war, our intelligence agencies discovered advanced and at times terrifying experiments by the Japanese and Germans involving the manipulation and control of the human mind. Many Nazis involved in such programs were arrested by our forces and after the war were employed to continue their studies. Our recent skirmishes with communist forces confirmed they were using their own techniques and experimenting on American prisoners of war. This is unacceptable and we cannot fall behind. As such, the Central Intelligence Agency recently launched Project MKUltra, which will experiment and study the use of specific drugs in order to improve interrogations and explore mind control. The CIA plans to launch tests on military personnel, employees, sex workers, prisoners, and mental patients in order to avoid public scrutiny as some Agency lawyers believe these experiments may violate laws regarding the CIA presence domestically."
CIA_DOM_50s.3.d:0 "Mass media is increasingly becoming a vital medium in how people across the globe consume news. The Soviets are already influencing and manipulating the media to further their political objectives and undermine the United States. To combat this foreign influence and subversion, the CIA recently initiated Operation Mockingbird. CIA agents are recruiting leading American journalists and influential civil groups in order to coordinate an effective response to the Soviet efforts. More importantly, the CIA can help propagate our own media offensives to better persuade the American and international community of our just cause and prevent the infiltration of foreign influence or American communists."
USA_Suez.5.d:0 "The London Stock Exchange has collapsed following news that the United States would begin calling in its war debt from the United Kingdom. This comes after the British government refused demands from Washington to halt its intervention in the Suez. The joint Anglo-French-Israeli invasion, launched after Egypt nationalized the Suez canal, caught the United States off guard. Many American leaders are likening the military action to colonial era gunboat diplomacy which has no role in the modern world and undermines the image of the West across the region. The decision to call in the war debt is leading to widespread panic across Britain, but it may be just the first action. If Britain continues the war, America may soon cut off economic aid, which would be disastrous to a nation still rebuilding from World War II."
USA_KOR_WITHDRAWAL.1.d:0 "The United States has begun withdrawing its forces from Korea. The President announced his decision after a high-level meeting with senior military and defense leaders. The President concluded that the American people had sacrificed and given all it could in supporting the cause of freedom in Korea. However, to stay on would be to sacrifice lives for no reasonable gain and it is time for the people of Korea to standup and fight for their own freedom. The news is being viewed as a fatal setback for the South Koreans and United Nations forces, as the loss of American forces now shift the balance of power noticeably to North Korea. The South Korean government and American allies have harshly criticized the American decision."
Albanian_Subversion.1.d:0 "The British SIS has approached us about a plan to overthrow the communist regime in Albania. The British believe that Enver Hoxha, the communist leader, is still in the process of consolidating his regime and there exists an opportunity to stop the communist expansion. The British believe, with our support, they can parachute highly trained anti-communist Albanian expats to the Mati region of the country. Mati is known for its conservatism and strong ties with the former royal family. The British believe the agents could organize a mass revolt and with supply drops, they can eventually overthrow Hoxha and end the communist threat."
Albanian_Subversion.5.d:0 "The British has helped establish the Free Albania National Committee. The organization consists of anti-communist Albanians living in the west. With this organization, we hope to recruit and organize these Albanian activists for the upcoming operation. The group will send the most promising members to the British for extensive training and preparation for the planned operation. Efforts to attract support for the organization from King Zog have stalled as the former monarch is not willing to compromise on his stance that he is the sole representative of Albanians. The CIA is not willing to be overly involved as they are concerned of the presence of formerly pro-Axis Albanian anti-communist exiles."
Albanian_Subversion.6.d:0 "The British government has approached the CIA for cooperation on its plans for instigating an anti-communist uprising in Albania. The British have established ties with the Free Albania National Committee. Through the organization, the group can provide agents to instigate the operation. However, the British have failed to bring the support of the former Albanian monarch, King Zog. The CIA believes the British have put in a lot of preparation but are concerned over the lack of royal support and presence of former pro-Axis Albanian exiles. Some in the Agency believe it may be a stronger approach to instead go our own way and work with King Zog to orchestrate a royalist uprising."
Albanian_Subversion.7.d:0 "The CIA has declined to cooperate with the proposed Albanian operation. They believe King Zog is the strongest route to provoke an anti-communist uprising. They have expressed skepticism over the feasibility of the SIS plan without backing from King Zog. The British are said to be very disappointed by this result and unsure how to proceed as they needed American bases and airpower for their plan. The CIA hopes the SIS will come around but are confident it will be able to succeed with King Zog."
Albanian_Subversion.8.d:0 "The United States recently launched a diplomatic and media campaign to condemn the Albanian communist regime of Enver Hoxha. The American government is calling for self-determination and accuse the communists of suppressing the rights of all Albanians. The CIA is also supporting the effort by pressing its allies in the international media to publicize reports of communist suppression and statements by anti-communist Albanian exiles. The effort is meant to undermine the communist regime and provide international support for future regime change."
Albanian_Subversion.9.d:0 "The United States announced it would resettle Albanian refugees in the country. The American government stated these refugees are victims of communist aggression and under threat in Europe. The public declaration is meant to expose the human rights situation in communist controlled Albania. For the CIA, the arrival of refugees will allow the organization to strengthen its ties with anti-communist Albanians and identify future operatives and political allies."
Albanian_Subversion.10.d:0 "The Assembly of Captive European Nations has organized in New York City under the supervision of the United States and private guidance from the CIA. The organization brings together anti-communist exiles from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, and Romania. The organization pledges to liberate their home countries through peaceful means and publicize the reality of life behind the cruel Iron Curtain. Along with the publication of periodicals and newspaper articles, the organization plans on opening branch offices in England, France, and Switzerland. The Soviet Union and its allies will be monitoring the group closely."
Albanian_Subversion.11.d:0 "The Albanian anti-communist revolt, led by Albanian exiles who returned to liberate their country, welcomed the return of King Zog to Tirana. The King had been living in exile since being forced to flee the country following the invasion of Italy in 1939. Although criticized for taking much of the gold reserves of Albania, though he has promised to return it and claimed he had only taken it to protect its theft by foreign powers. The anti-communist uprising drew its largest supporters from regions that remained loyal to the King. While addressing a massive crowd of supporters, King Zog promised to restore Albanian dignity and wealth. Communist neighboring states have condemned the return of King Zog, calling it the beginning of a reactionary nightmare for the people of Albania. The United States and its allies welcome the return of King Zog as a restoration of political freedom to the people of Albania."
US_STEEL.0.d:0 "The price of steel in the United States has seen a dramatic increase. This has raised the concern of President [USA.GetLeader] and his economic advisors. They believe the steel industry, especially dominated by the U.S. Steel corporation, is coordinating its efforts to increase the price of steel to maximize profits. The President believes the price increases will risk an inflationary crisis and could weaken the defense industry if a crisis were to emerge. He is believed to be considering the breakup of U.S. Steel as a way to promote more economic competition and lower prices. However, he would have to consider the potential consequences and legal challenges such an action would cause. U.S. Steel argues the prices are due to the market and increased worker wages. It strongly opposes any attempt at federal interference in its operations."
US_STEEL.5.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] recently directed the government to investigate U.S. Steel for manipulating the market while directing his legal team to begin anti-trust lawsuits to break up the corporation. The President stated that U.S. Steel possessed an unfair monopoly in the steel market and had stifled competition. He proposed the corporation could either go through a series of lawsuits and investigations, or it could simply agree to breakup. After a board meeting, U.S. Steel responded by agreeing to the demands of the President and initiated plans to split the company. The President is facing criticism for what many business leaders call an overreach of executive power, however, many Americans applaud the President for his efforts to protect consumers and promote competition in business."
US_STEEL.6.d:0 "When asked questions about the surge in steel prices, President [USA.GetLeader] stated that while he felt for the American people and industries dependent on steel, this was the price of a free economy. When asked about calls in the press for the President to intervene to force prices down or breakup major steel corporations, the President stated this was not an option. In its own statement, U.S. Steel reiterated that the current price hike was not part of an elaborate scheme but the result of the current market prices and demand."
Decolonization_USA.50.d:0 "A recent speech by the President of the United States has raised eyebrows in capitals across Western Europe. The President condemned European colonialism as a denial to the inalienable rights of colonized people to self-determination and freedom. He noted, continued colonialism only held up archaic systems and radicalized populations against the liberties and progress Democracy offered the world. He called on all European powers with colonies to begin the process of decolonization and help usher in a new global order of free trade, democracy, and cooperation in Africa and Asia."
Korean_War_Yan.1.d:0 "The United States has requested our forces launch an immediate operation to liberate the mainland from the communists. The United States recently started a war with the communist regime and appear committed to destroying it. The Americans stated their appreciation of our commitment to democracy in China and believe our operations would greatly aid their efforts to defeat the communists. Many of the commanders believe we should act now in the interest of China and to tie down Chinese forces. However, some of the commanders are urging caution, saying we would be operating outside the main American forces and would risk the annihilation of our forces. They believe we should decline the request and attack at the time and place of our choosing."
Korean_War_Yan.2.d:0 "The Republic of China forces have agreed to our request for them to launch operations on the mainland. This is welcome news for our operations. The Chinese will be stretched thin to defend its coast and borders, giving us the option to strike at their weak points. It will also legitimize our mission as liberators of China and champions to its democratic forces. We can expect reports of Kuomintang offensives in the coming days."
Korean_War_Yan.3.d:0 "The Republic of China forces have declined our request for them to launch operations on the mainland. This is a major setback for our war efforts. The participation of ROCA forces would have stretched the communists thin and given greater flexibility to our operations. The CIA believes the Nationalist commanders were concerned of casualties and perhaps have grown too comfortable in their bases and control of the island of Taiwan and in the golden triangle."
Korean_War_Yan.4.d:0 "Reports from China and Burma indicate that the remnants of the Republic of China's Eighth Army has launched an invasion of communist China through the Yunnan province alongside main forces in Taiwan preparing amphibious attacks on the southeastern coastal regions of mainland China. The Peoples Republic of China promised an immediate retaliation and have downplayed the threat. However, this invasion may end up being disastrous as the communists will now have to commit troops elsewhere as it engages in a direct war with the United States. The American government welcomed the news, calling it an intervention of a liberation force seeking to end communist tyranny."
Korean_War_Yan.5.d:0 "We have received news from Taipei that the Republic of China has officially joined the Korean War on the side of the United States, and has asked us to establish a new front over in Yunnan. Many of our officers, whom are loyal to Chiang and the anti-communist cause wants us to accept the call to arms."
Decolonization_USA.2.d:0 "In a recent address, the President called for the decolonization of Africa. The President stated the American people have always supported the cause of liberty and freedom. In pursuance of these values, the end of colonialism and freedom for all Africans is a vital interest to the United States. He ended the address by urging those nations still holding colonies to recognize decolonization is the only just path forward. The address will no doubt cause concern among the colonial powers, but the American government believes it has gained new friends and legitimacy across the African continent. Many anti-colonial organizations have welcomed the news. American businesses and economists are also showing support as ending colonial rule will open new markets for American goods and influence."
Decolonization_USA.3.d:0 "The shift to embrace decolonization, at the risk of alienating powerful allies reflects a return to Wilsonian diplomacy. The American State Department announced the United States firmly supports self-determination for all colonized peoples. This new American effort is meant to strengthen American ties with the newly emerging states and challenge the Soviets as the champion of anti-colonialism in Africa. Privately, the Soviets are said to be concerned over this challenge and there are fears among some Soviet leaders that the Americans may spread this self-determination stance to Soviet influenced areas in Europe and Asia."
Decolonization_USA.4.d:0 "The State Department announced the United States intends to invite newly independent African states to join the Technical Assistance Program. The American government believes the program will provide key technical assistance to aid the transformation of these states into stable, democratic nations. This invitation continues the recent American embrace of decolonization and many see the Technical Assistance Program as a way for America to improve its influence in the continent and curb the threat of communist influence."
Decolonization_USA.1.d:0 "The situation in Africa is rapidly changing. Across the continent, millions are advocating either for greater self-rule or independence from colonial powers. The expansion of education and more radical ideologies in colonies is fueling anti-colonial activism. The State Department believes European powers continuing to hold colonies, even with force, risk radicalizing their colonial subjects and opening the path to communist influence. Some believe the United States must use its leverage over European colonial states to push decolonization, in order to prevent radicalization and open these territories to American cultural and economic influence. However, another group argues such an approach will only facilitate the rise of radical regimes and instead they urge the United States to more openly support colonial states. We can encourage them to implement reforms so they can eventually transfer power to local, pro-Western African elites."
Radio_Free_Europe.1.d:0 "The National Committee for a Free Europe (NCFE) recently launched a new radio station called Radio Free Europe. This new station will conduct broadcasts across Europe and the Iron Curtain to battle communist propaganda. The CIA controls the NCFE and has recruited many prominent anti-communists to support its efforts. Radio Free Europe will broadcast accounts from refugees who have escaped communist regimes. The station is being widely applauded across the United States as a strong response to the rising communist threat."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.2.d:0 "The failed attempt to oust the government of Jacobo Arbenz has resulted in him strengthening his hold over the country. With this stronger support, he will no doubt expand efforts to seize lands and facilities of American interests like United Fruit Company in the country. The CIA believes this will inevitably lead to a transformation of Guatemala into a Soviet client. However, this is not occurring yet. In order to not lose Guatemala and act before the situation is completely untenable, the CIA has a plan to leak certain intelligence in a way to make it appear the Soviets are already making moves to enter the country. Once the American people see Guatemala is on the verge of hosting Soviet forces, we can deploy the military to secure the country."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.1.d:0 "The failure of the CIA to control the situation in Guatemala reflects a wider failure of the Monroe Doctrine. For decades, the Monroe Doctrine has secured our interest and region from hostile ideologies or foreign interference. However, the recent failure highlights the limitations of American influence and now Guatemala is at risk of becoming a Soviet client. Our failure in Guatemala is an open signal to anti-American forces across the hemisphere to begin operations and plans to carry out their own agendas. American allies have also lost faith in our protection and may seek to look elsewhere for support."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.3.d:0 "Reports are spreading across the American and Western press of increasing Soviet influence over the Guatemalan government of Jacobo Arbenz. The reports indicate the Soviets are planning on quickly establishing a relationship with the country and establishing bases in the country. Editorials are already calling for the President to act. The American people are not comfortable with Soviet troops being deployed only miles from the United States. The President is gaining the necessary public backing to take more drastic action to resolve the Guatemalan situation."
PBSUCCESS_AFTERMATH.50.d:0 "The leftist regime in Guatemala has solidified its control over the country and instituted draconian measures to curb dissent and setup the further nationalization of foreign companies in the country, especially United Fruit Company, a vital American corporation. The CIA responded with operation PBSuccess, which sought to establish radio broadcasts and instill widespread fear and panic among the Guatemalan people. In this chaotic environment, the Guatemalan military, with its pro-American and anti-communist leadership, would be able to rally even pro-government officers to intervene and end the regime of Jacob Arbenz. However, this plan failed. Once news was leaked of an impending Soviet deployment, the President was able to order the United States military to invade Guatemala to restore democracy and protect American citizens and property in the country, with the support of the American people."
USA_Israel_Lobby.1.d:0 "The situation in the Middle East is precarious. Although the recent Arab-Israeli War has ended in an armistice, both sides appear to be gearing up for a second round of fighting. The Arab World possess valuable resources, especially oil. The Israelis are establishing a democratic state and has a strong affinity towards the West and has the sympathy of the American people. The administration must decide how it will proceed. One group advocates a strong pro-Israel policy including arms deals, this will be well-received by the public and pro-Israeli interests. The Israelis could also help secure our interests in the region. However, doing so would risk Arab ire and access to oil. The other group believes we must maintain neutrality in order to maintain and grow ties with Arab states. From this position we could help broker a future agreement to the long-term benefit of both the Israelis and Arabs."
USA_Israel_Lobby.2.d:0 "The United States, Britain, and France have signed the Tripartite Declaration. The three states pledge to maintain the territorial status quo of as established by the recent Arab-Israeli Armistice agreements. The agreement confirms the commitment of these states to peace and stability in the Middle East and prevent any side from destabilizing the precarious peace. The agreement is being welcomed by the Arab states, desperately rebuilding their military capabilities. The Israelis are said to be upset as they believe their military advantage will soon be lost as the three states also agreed to limit arms sales to the region."
USA_Israel_Lobby.3.d:0 "The United States has refused to sign a proposed Tripartite Declaration proposed by Britain in France. The agreement would call on all three state to preserve the current territorial status quo between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It would also have stipulated the three parties would work to control arms sales to the region. The American government argued the agreement was anti-Israeli as it would deny them access to defense aid while allowing Arab states to more effectively rearm on the global market with its stronger financial position. The American rejection indicates its support for Israel and the Arab states are said to be furious over their position."
Ajax_USA.5.d:0 "The State Department announced the United States strongly opposes the recent nationalization of foreign oil interests in Iran. Such unilateral actions hinder the potential of future investment in Iran and unfairly punish those with interests in these corporations. The United States urges Iran to reconsider its approach and return to the negotiating table to reach a just resolution. The announcement is being welcomed by the British who continue to try and rally international support for its position."
Ajax_USA.6.d:0 "The President of the United States informed the National Security Council that America would not militarily intervene in Iran. The President stated his hope that both Britain and Iran can resolve their disputes peacefully. At this stage, a military escalation would only cause more suffering and greatly weaken the image of the United States abroad. The British government was also informed of this decision and they are expected to be disappointed. If Britain were to launch its own military operations, it would do so at the risk of provoking a negative American reaction."
Ajax_USA.15.d:0 "The President has directed the State Department to criticize British involvement in Iranian affairs. The United States cannot condone such blatant interference as it risks enflaming tensions in the region. It would also weaken Western prestige among post-colonial states. The CIA is being directed to cut off any cooperation with the British over intelligence operations in Iran. If the British insist on its current course, it will have to do so on its own."
Ajax_USA.7.d:0 "The British failure to overthrow the Iranian government has caused it to consider more drastic measures to prevent the nationalization of oil and further erosion of valuable Western interests in the country. The British are now calling on us to support them both militarily and politically in an invasion of Iran. Supporting an invasion and new regime could firmly cement Western control of a key regional state and strengthen British ties. The British also argue the current Iranian government is close to the communist Tudeh Party and if not removed, Iran may be the victim of a Soviet sponsored communist coup. However, such an invasion may have other consequences, such as radicalizing Iranian opposition to us and provoking a wider, regional backlash. The potential reaction of the Soviets must also be considered."
Ajax_USA.8.d:0 "The United States has agreed to our proposal to remove the Iranian government through military action. The current regime in Tehran is clearly under the thrall of the pro-Soviet Tudeh. It is only a matter of time before a Soviet sponsored coup sees Iran become a Soviet satellite. If this were to occur, the Soviets would be in the heart of the middle east. The nationalization efforts and anti-British demonstrations are proof of communist influence. With American support, we can expect a swift victory and diplomatic cover in our operations."
Ajax_USA.9.d:0 "The United States has rejected our proposal to remove the Iranian government through military action. The current regime in Tehran is clearly under the thrall of the pro-Soviet Tudeh. It is only a matter of time before a Soviet sponsored coup sees Iran become a Soviet satellite. If this were to occur, the Soviets would be in the heart of the middle east. The Americans are choosing to ignore the dangerous implications of the recent nationalization efforts and anti-British demonstrations. If necessary, we may need to remove the Iranian threat ourselves, but this will likely result in American diplomatic objections."
Containment_Policy.1.d:0 "The biggest challenge to global order is the rise of radical communist movements across Europe and Asia following 1945. The Soviet Union is blatantly supporting these efforts and are offering arms, training, and cash to these organizations to subvert and overthrow democratic regimes. In territories under Soviet military occupation they have simply purged non-communist political parties and forcibly established communist regimes. To combat this, the United States is establishing alliances among the frontline states facing communists and encouraging collective defense. American military, economic, and political aid will protect these states from overt and covert communist threats. The goal is to surround the communist world and contain it from further expansion."
USA_CWC.1.d:0 "The Chinese Civil War is raging, the Republic of China is struggling to stop the communist Peoples Republic of China. The years of internal conflicts and World War II have sapped much of the Republic of China strength. We must consider our options to approaching the situation. One option is to let things play out, our involvement may only prolong the fighting, bolster the communists, or deplete our own strength. The other option is to approach the United Nations to rally international cooperation in resolving the conflict in favor of the Republic of China. Finally, we can simply intervene directly. We can provide advisors, equipment, and if necessary, a military intervention to save the Chinese people from communist tyranny."
USA_CWC.2.d:0 "We have received news from the United States that they were seeking our support to organize a group of Volunteer units under the Western bloc to intervene in the Civil War should a Resolution involving Police Action fail. It is clear that the fall of the Nationalist regime may affect our impact in Asia radically, though the rescue of the regime would be hard at this point of time. We should reply to the American Pressure soon."
USA_ROC.1.d:0 "We have received news that Sun Li-Jen has agreed to our proposal of couping Chiang with the help of the CIA and using him to replace the despotic government of Chiang's with his. He has handpicked a selected amount of Pro-American advisors from the Kuomintang to help him form a new government when the time comes."
USA_ROC.2.d:0 "We have received news that everything has finally been placed in order, allowing us to execute the CIA Coup in Taipei. The planning has involved complexed situations allowing us to kill the Generalissimo without public knowledge alongside senior government officials. As of now CIA reconnaissance has been planted in Taiwan to allow us to keep track of the whereabouts of Government officials of the ROC."
USA_ROC.3.d:0 "Recently, a coup has occured in the streets of Taipei with supposed CIA involvement in it. The island of Formosa is in a state of chaos with Chiang Kai-Shek now gone from power, with him being last seen in his government office painting caligraphy in his leisure time. The population in Formosa has some expressing displeasure with the government now gone and law was no longer in place, though some were glad that the authoritarian government has gone missing and that democracy may arrive soon."
CCW_USA.10.d:0 "In a somber address, the President informed the American people that the United States military would be intervening in the Chinese Civil War. The President said the Republic of China had been a close ally to the United States during the last war, holding the line against the Japanese Empire at tremendous cost. He also noted the close bonds made by the two sides during the war, including the sacrifice of many Chinese lives to protect and host American airmen. He concluded by stating the communists were seeking to exploit an exhausted Chinese nation with its nefarious operations and the people of China needed direct American help to ensure the freedom of its people."
CCW_USA.11.d:0 "The 1949 China White Paper, officially titled "United States Relations with China, With Special Reference to the Period 1944–1949, was published by the U.S. Department of State under the administration of President Harry S. Truman. This document aimed to explain and justify American policy toward China during the tumultuous period that culminated in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) victory in the Chinese Civil War. The White Paper highlighted several key points such as the Historical Context of the Civil War and the U.S. Policy during the Civil War. However, it has been criticized by Congressional Republicans for misleading the public about the nature of Mao and Communist Movement."
CWC_Police_Action.1.d:0 "The United States has presented a resolution at the United Nations Security Council calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The United States claims the PRC has continuously violated international norms and engaged in gross crimes against its own people. A successful UN vote would give legitimacy for military action against PRC and help establish an international coalition. The only obstacle to the resolution is the Soviet Union, which has veto power on the security council."
CWC_Police_Action.2.d:0 "The United States recently presented a resolution to the United Nations Security Council calling for police against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The United States is trying to build international consensus on its proposed military operations. The PRC is a communist state, however, their leadership at times has been erratic and has shown a desire to eventually challenge our leadership of the communist world. They have at times questioned our revolutionary path. It maybe in our interest to abstain from the vote and allow our two rivals to weaken themselves in armed conflict. However, China is a major communist state and not using our veto could result in a major reversal for communism in Asia."
CWC_Police_Action.3.d:0 "The Soviet Union used its veto power to halt the United States resolution calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This is a major blow for the Americans who wanted to garner international support for military action. The other communist states are praising our action for defending socialism. The West will no doubt be infuriated but this is nothing new. The PRC also expressed their satisfaction and we can look forward to better relations for the near future."
CWC_Police_Action.4.d:0 "In a surprise move, the Soviet Union elected to abstain from the United Nations Security Council resolution calling for police action against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). This is a major victory for the United States, which proposed the resolution. Although Soviet allies are not outright condemning the action, many leftist and communist movements have already expressed outrage over the action. The PRC has also condemned the Soviet decision and are openly questioning their revolutionary credentials. The United States will now be able to carry out its military objectives with regards to the PRC."
USA_VIE50s.3.d:0 "The CIA director presented a plan to the President on a way to ensure the ballots are rigged in our favor in the upcoming Reunification Elections in Vietnam. We have established a fairly robust intelligence network in the country. The plan will involve cash, incentives, and some clandestine manipulation of the votes to ensure a democratic victory for the people of Vietnam. However, such an operation may be uncovered and could have drastic consequences in the region. To not act would risk us losing the entire country and potentially the region to a new wave of communism."
Vietnam_RefferendumAH.5.d:0 "The people of Vietnam voted to reject unification. It appears the people of South Vietnam have no interest in being unified and under the control of communist North Vietnam. The results are being welcomed by the American backed South Vietnamese government who argued the North Vietnam government lacked sincerity in holding free elections. The North Vietnamese government has accused the South and its allies of manipulating the results to ensure it did not result in unification and the establishment of a true government that represents the people of Vietnam. They are calling for all the people of Vietnam to express their displeasure and pledged to redouble their efforts in liberating all Vietnamese people."
USA_VIE50s.2.d:0 "The United States has agreed to plans for Reunification Elections in Vietnam that came out of the recently signed Geneva Accords. The agreement came after assurances from the communist north that the election will be overseen by international observers. Our agreement means the South Vietnamese will have to go along with it despite their reservations. The CIA also claims it is unsure how the election will turn out. Regardless, denying the election may only make the southern government unpopular and turn the Vietnamese public overwhelmingly in support of the communists, who claim to represent the nation."
USA_VIE50s.4.d:0 "Following Reunification Elections, the people of Vietnam have decided to unite under a coalition government of the communist north and non-communist south. The results have seen thousands take to the streets in celebration, many Vietnamese see this as the end of their struggle for peace and independence. The CIA believes the coalition appears stable for now, but warn it may quickly unravel if either side seeks to expand their base. We will monitor the situation closely and work to ensure the communists do not use this as an opportunity to launch a coup and seize power from the freedom loving people of Vietnam."
USA_VIE50s.8.d:0 "The United States will back South Vietnam in its rejection of the Geneva Accords. The South Vietnamese believe the agreement gives the communists a base from which to undermine their government. More importantly, proposals for a Reunification Election are not tenable as the communists will clearly manipulate the vote in its favor, through all means at its disposal. The CIA agrees with this assessment and to ensure South Vietnam is not isolated, we are whole heartedly supporting their stance. The communists will have to make proper compromises and guarantee no subversion for any lasting agreement can be achieved."
American_Aid.5.d:0 "The President directed the Defense Department and State Department to shift aid earmarked for France to Korea and Japan. The United States has determined providing more support to Asia is much more important than focusing so much on Europe. France is a developed and strong nation, it will not be greatly hindered, though the French government will likely not respond well to our decision. The Japanese and Korean government are already expressing their thanks with our increased support. They are crucial frontline states against communism and must be supported."
American_Aid.6.d:0 "The United States announced it would shift aid meant for Britain, Australia, and other commonwealth states to India, Pakistan, and the Philippines. The American government recognizes these states are under the risk of Soviet influence and this must be countered. The commonwealth states will be upset by our action, but they will not be overly affected by our actions. The action emphasizes our focus on securing the battle for influence in South Asia and the Pacific."
American_Aid.1.d:0 "The Mutual Security Act was recently passed in Congress. It is a new foreign aid program that will enable the United States to provide aid and grants to friendly states. The support will help those states develop their capabilities and more firmly be able to resist communist influence. Unlike earlier programs, the support will not be limited to any one region or state. It will give the President greater flexibility and strengthen the State Department as it continues to wage diplomatic battles to secure American influence against an increasingly belligerent Soviet foreign policy."
USA_Korean_War.10.d:0 "The United States has declared war on the Peoples Republic of China. The communist Chinese intervention in the war has resulted in massive losses for both sides and heavy fighting between Chinese and American forces. The President addressed congress and described the overt Chinese support for the North Koreans. The deployment of Chinese troops along with heavy weapons and combat aircraft indicates their resolve to wage open warfare on the United States. Not declaring war gives all the flexibility and advantage to China, leaving American troops in Korea vulnerable. But with a declaration of war, the United States can expand its options and hold the communist Chinese regime accountable for its actions. After his comments, Congress voted overwhelmingly to declare war."
CCW_USA.5.d:0 "The United States has called for the international community to step up to provide desperately needed humanitarian aid to the Republic of China. The American representative at the United Nations noted the people of China have faced decades of civil war and warfare, and the communists, instead of joining hands in peace, are instead seeking to exploit this exhaustion for its own gains. Humanitarian aid would provide relief to the Chinese people and the government as it seeks to face the military challenges while also providing basic services to the population. The Peoples Republic of China through their communist allies have condemned the American request, citing it as an attempt to have the international community subsidize the war effort of the Republic of China."
CWC_Police_Action.0.d:0 "As the news from China continues to paint a picture of a beleaguered Republic of China losing ground to the communist Peoples Republic of China, there are increasing reports of a potential American intervention. Topics related to China are said to dominate meetings at the Pentagon, White House, and intelligence agencies. American officers with experience in China during the war are being recalled or redeployed to the Pentagon. In press conferences government officials are constantly expressing concern for the global ramifications of a communist victory in China. These reports are raising concern in Moscow and other communist states that the United States may soon be on the verge of intervening in the Chinese Civil War, risking a dramatic international escalation to the conflict."
American_Ceasefire_Request.1.d:0 "The United States has requested a ceasefire for the conflict in Korea. The arrival of our forces tipped the balance of power against the capitalist Americans and their puppet forces. It is clear they do not see an opportunity to achieve a victory and are not asking for a halt to fighting. Some of our senior advisors advocate this is an opportunity and we should redouble our efforts to achieve total victory. Another group of advisors believe China has demonstrated its commitment to the global revolution and has rendered immense aid in both blood and treasure. They argue we should accept the ceasefire and concentrate on building our socialist state so that we can strike at the Americans when we are at our strongest."
American_Ceasefire_Request.2.d:0 "We recently sent a request for a ceasefire with to the Chinese. They are effectively holding the communist forces together and getting them to agree to a ceasefire would end the fighting. However, the Chinese have foolishly declined the request. It appears they believe victory is at hand for their forces. However, our troops are more than capable of holding them back and punishing them for their mistake. With this Chinese rejection, our commanders are now planning new operations to demonstrate to China that victory is impossible."
American_Ceasefire_Request.3.d:0 "We recently sent a request for a ceasefire with to the Chinese. They are effectively holding the communist forces together and getting them to agree to a ceasefire would end the fighting. Our request has been accepted and plans are underway for a meeting between frontline commanders to ensure a smooth disengagement. The United Nations forces, and American troops have fought bravely against overwhelming odds. The Chinese no doubt also reached the same conclusion that continuing the fighting will achieve nothing and just further sap their forces."
American_Ceasefire_Request.4.d:0 "The bitter fighting in Korea appears to be drawing to a close following news that both sides have agreed to a ceasefire. The war started with the invasion of South Korea by communist North Korea. This provoked the United States to intervene in defense of the South with allied forces under a United Nations mandate. The fighting quickly escalated into a major regional conflict that has recently dissolved into a stalemate with neither side able to achieve a decisive victory. The ceasefire is being welcomed by both sides and the people of both North and South Korea will no doubt be breathing a sigh of relief that the fighting has come to a halt."
PRC_USA_KOR.1.d:0 "Through private channels, the United States has indicated it will soon launch nuclear weapons against our nation unless we withdraw from the Korean conflict. This is a bold threat by either a desperate or bloodthirsty capitalist regime. Some of our senior officials argue the threat is a desperate ploy as our forces have the capitalists and their puppets on the run. To stop now would be foolish and give them the ability to use nuclear blackmail for other conflicts, like the fight for Taipei. However, other officials believe the threat is genuine and fits the American desire for victory at any cost. They argue our initial intervention shows the commitment of China to global revolution and to withdraw now would not leave China vulnerable, it would instead buy time for China to counter the nuclear blackmail. We must either stay and fight, or tactically withdraw."
PRC_USA_KOR.4.d:0 "The Chinese have rebuffed our threats of unleashing our nuclear arsenal against them. China apparently believes we are bluffing and unwilling to bring nuclear weapons into the conflict. The Pentagon is ready to begin preparing the first round of bombs and targets. Using these weapons can turn the tide, reduce our casualties, and perhaps force China into submission. However, some of our senior defense leaders are expressing caution. They fear the consequences of nuclear strikes in Korea, it may provoke a wider conflict or even a Soviet reaction. There are also fears that our decision to bring nuclear weapons into a small regional conflict may set a precedent that allows other states in the future to act similarly. We must decide whether to escalate the conflict, or back down from our threats."
PRC_USA_KOR.2.d:0 "The Chinese government, using private channels, indicated they have heard our warning and will soon begin the withdrawal of Chinese forces from Korea. The Chinese state that this is a tactical withdrawal and warned us to stay away from their border. This is a major victory for us and once the Chinese withdrawal occurs, the balance of power in Korea will shift in our favor. More importantly, this shows the successful ability to tactically use the threat of our nuclear arsenal in order to gain diplomatic and military advantages abroad. Many in the Pentagon are very thrilled that their investment in expanding the nuclear arsenal has paid dividends and likely saved the lives of many American soldiers."
PRC_USA_KOR.3.d:0 "In a surprise announcement, the Peoples Republic of China declared it had achieved its objectives in defending China from capitalist incursions and will begin withdrawing its forces from Korea immediately. The Chinese government added that any further incursions would be swiftly dealt with. The United States and its allies will welcome the news as it shifts the military balance into their favor. Chinese allies are left puzzled as rumors swirl that the Chinese decision may be linked to American threats of introducing its nuclear arsenal to the conflict."
PRC_USA_KOR.10.d:0 "After a bitter conflict, which started with an unprovoked invasion by North Korea, the Republic of Korea has emerged triumphant. With the support of United Nations forces led by the United States, Korea has finally been unified. For the first time since the nineteenth century, Korea is a united, independent state. The Korean government announced it will soon begin a de-communism program and uproot all remnants of the previous regime. The victory was only achieved following the withdrawal of Chinese forces from the conflict, this tipped the balance of power overwhelmingly in favor of the United States and its allies."
USA_VIE50s.10.d:0 "The referendum on the future unification of Vietnam will be held soon. The government must decide whether it will accept the results or reject them. The communists have a powerful propaganda machine and grassroots program. This infiltration of the countryside along with their totalitarian control of the north suggests they could manipulate the polls extensively. However, they have promised to allow the vote to occur freely under international observers. Rejecting the results would alienate our international friends and if we condemn the polls ahead of time and end up getting a positive result, it would be a major blunder. The government must decide if the elections can be trusted."
CWC_Police_Action.5.d:0 "The United States announced its forces had initiated its Police Action against the Peoples Republic of China. The American government continues to insist that the PRC has engaged in an indiscriminate and wanton war of aggression against the Republic of China. The American military action is only meant to halt this aggression and restore peace to the people of China. The communist Chinese government condemned the American intervention, likening it to the gunboat diplomacy of the colonial period and an attempt to colonize China. The Republic of China welcomed the American intervention and criticized the PRC for blatant propaganda."
CWC_Police_Action.6.d:0 "The United States has publicly urged both its own forces and forces of the Western bloc to intervene on behalf of the Kuomintang in the Chinese Civil War as a result of the failed resolution for a Police Action. The American government continues to insist that the PRC has engaged in an indiscriminate and wanton war of aggression against the Republic of China. The American military action is only meant to halt this aggression and restore peace to the people of China. The communist Chinese government condemned the American intervention, likening it to the gunboat diplomacy of the colonial period and an attempt to colonize China. The Republic of China welcomed the American intervention and criticized the PRC for blatant propaganda."
Ajax_USA.16.d:0 "A combined British and American military force has initiated an invasion of Iran. This is the second British military intervention in Iran since 1939, it comes in response to the Iranian decision to nationalize its oil industry. The United States supports the British claims of its interests being illegally seized. They also support the British stance that the current Iranian government is facing the risk of a communist takeover or is already under covert communist control. Military leaders in Washington and London express confidence of a swift military victory. The Iranian government condemned the intervention and are calling on the international community to support Iran as it faces an imperialist invasion."
KW_EARLY.5.d:0 "The Korean War has come to an end following the announcement that North Korea and the United Nations have agreed to a ceasefire. The conflict began with a surprise invasion of South Korea by North Korea. The communist North Korea government sought to forcibly reunify Korea under its rule. However, the United Nations voted for an intervention led by the United States. After heavy fighting, the conflict had evolved into a bloody stalemate between both sides. With neither party able to gain the upper hand, a ceasefire was signed that will restore the prewar borders. The international community has largely welcomed the end of the fighting."
KW_EARLY.6.d:0 "The treacherous Americans and their puppet allies have refused our just request that all POWs be repatriated to their home country. They insist that every POW will be given the choice to repatriate or remain in the corrupt south. No doubt their extensive propaganda campaign has yielded some successes, which they will use to embarrass us. Many in the Central Committee believe the only response is to continue the war. Once the enemy is sufficiently bled, they will give in to their ridiculous stance. Others however believe the fighting has gone on long enough, and that we should trust the revolutionary vigor of our men. They urge we drop our demand and end the fighting to begin the rebuilding of our nation. In their eyes, those who refuse to return were traitors from the beginning and will be dealt with when we complete the unification of our people."
KW_EARLY.1.d:0 "The South Korean puppet master, the United States, recently initiated ceasefire negotiations with our forces. Our revolutionary spirit and resistance have stalled their nefarious designs. Their immense wealth and advanced weaponry could not overcome our forces. At the moment, they hold tens of thousands of our comrades in prison camps undergoing intensive propaganda. Before any ceasefire can be achieved, we will demand these men be returned home. The Americans insist they will not forcibly repatriate any POWs but talks cannot continue unless they do."
KW_EARLY.2.d:0 "Our talks with North Korea over a ceasefire agreement stalled. The North Koreans are insisting we repatriate all their POWs. This goes against our present position that all POWs should be given the choice to either stay or be sent back. Many POWs express fears of being tortured or even killed if forced back. Others have converted to Christianity and fear religious persecution if returned. Giving into the communist demands would hasten the end of the conflict, however, it would go against all we stand for and alienate the American public. Or we could stick to our stance until the North Koreans drop the demand, they are taking the full brunt of the war and will likely give in in time."
KW_EARLY.3.d:0 "The capitalist stooges agreed to our just demand to return all our POWS. Their scheme of using our comrades for their propaganda purposes and to undermine our revolution has been thwarted. Once our men are returned, we can begin the process of debriefing and reeducation as needed. This removes the final hurdles to our ceasefire talks. Soon, this long struggle will come to an end. We can begin the process of rebuilding our nation and preparing to complete the sacred mission we started."
KW_EARLY.4.d:0 "After difficult talks, the North Koreans have finally agreed to a ceasefire. Our long struggle in Korea has ended. The American people can be proud that its soldiers carried out their duty and our government completed its commitment to the United Nations mission. Despite desperate odds, against an overwhelming communist force, our men held the line. The United States has demonstrated it will stand ready to counter violent communist expansion wherever it occurs. International communism will now think twice before threatening any free nation."
USA_1952_Buildup.1.d:0 "The Democratic Party leaders are growing increasingly concerned by the surging popularity of General Douglas MacArthur, the lead Republican presidential candidate. To counter the popular war hero, General Dwigth D. Eisenhower is being approached to be the Democratic candidate for president. General Eisenhower is perhaps the only officer who can be said to have matched or surpassed the achievements of MacArthur in the war. Eisenhower is also much more popular among the Washington and Pentagon establishment. The Democrats hope its own war hero candidate will be able to defeat the Republican candidate."
USA_1952_Buildup.2.d:0 "General Douglas MacArthur is quickly emerging as the strongest Republican candidate for President. His status as a war hero and natural charisma makes him a very attractive candidate to the voters. For the Republican establishment, MacArthur is viewed with suspicion and a new movement is underway to consolidate establishment support for one candidate to challenge MacArthur. The three options are Governor Thomas Dewey, Governor Harold Stassen, and Governor Earl Warren. All three options are established politicians capable of working within the political system and with the opposition. Republican leaders believe picking of these three candidates to focus establishment support could defeat MacArthur and offer a presidential candidate who can appeal to all Americans."
Decolonization_VIE.1.d:0 "The United States took the unusual step of publicly calling for Free Elections in Vietnam. This comes after the defeat of the communist Viet Minh by the government. The American stance indicates its support for the wishes of the Vietnamese people to be respected, even if the election sees the rise of pro-Communists. This reflects the recent American embrace of decolonization and self-determination. The American government believes its policies will strengthen international support for the United States and ultimately lead to stronger relationships and more stable allies."
AmericanOffer.4.d:0 "The governments of North and South Vietnam agreed to reunify the country following intense negotiations. A new coalition government of unity will be established. The new state pledges it will rebuild what was destroyed in the recent wars and lay the foundation for a strong, independent Vietnam state. In terms of foreign policy the new state pledges it will not intertwine itself with foreign conflicts and risk being a client to any power. Instead, Vietnam will pursue a nonaligned position and be a friend to all. The news is being welcomed as a great diplomatic victory for all the states involved in the negotiations, especially the United States, Soviet Union, and France."
AmericanOffer.1.d:0 "The United States, using backdoor diplomacy have submitted a private offer to our government. They have pledged to withdraw their opposition to reunification on the guarantee we pledge to remain non-aligned in our foreign policy. If we accept the American proposal, the South Vietnamese will have no choice but to accept the elections and we will likely achieve our goal of a unified, independent Vietnam. However, to accept their demand will mean we compromise on foreign policy. The Politburo is divided by the offer. One faction urges an acceptance as this would ensure the rapid unification of the country and the implementation of the revolution across Vietnam. The other faction sees the offer as a sign of American weakness and to sacrifice our foreign policy would compromise any independence. They urge we continue to push for complete independence. The debate must reach a conclusion…"
AmericanOffer.2.d:0 "Our proposal to support reunification in exchange for a nonaligned Vietnam has been accepted by the North Vietnamese. This seems to confirm some of our intelligence which suggests that though communist, they are much more focused on securing and promoting Vietnamese independence and national identity. Although the solution is not necessarily ideal, we have successfully prevented Vietnam from being a bastion of communist and Soviet expansion in the region."
AmericanOffer.3.d:0 "Our proposal to support reunification in exchange for a nonaligned Vietnam has been rejected by the North Vietnamese. Their decision does not surprise many of our intelligence experts who have long viewed the regime a front for international communism. The rejection confirms they are not a nationalist, anti-colonial force as they claim to the public. They ultimately seek to put all Vietnamese under their oppressive control and then use Vietnam as a base to spread communism across the region. We should consider redoubling our support to the South Vietnamese."
USA_INDO.1.d:0 "The American President sent his Secretary of State to deliver a message to our government during a recent visit. The Americans believe the current situation in Indochina is deteriorating and our continued operations will only lead to disaster. They are urging us to consider and begin a diplomatic resolution for the conflict. Although not explicitly stated, it was implied that our refusal to begin talks may result in a reduction of American aid, especially military aid. The senior defense officials believe such a scenario may be catastrophic to our ability to maintain the fight. Perhaps it is time to end this war and dispatch our senior diplomatic and political leaders to begin the process of starting talks."
nato_expansion.1.d:0 "In a recent conference of NATO leaders, discussion was held on expanding the organization to include more frontline states to the organization and strengthen the collective defense of free Europe. West Germany, Greece, and Turkey are all facing communist forces on its borders and the risk of subversion. Leaving these states on their own risks their overthrow and would compromise the position of NATO versus the Soviet Union. These states can be strengthened and protected from overt and covert Soviet threats. However, the proposal to offer membership is being met by resistance, some members are leery of including West Germany so soon after the war. Others fear Greece and Turkey may end up being more of a liability due to their weaker economy and military."
nato_expansion.3.d:0 "NATO has offered us membership to their organization. By joining NATO we would be protected under their mutual defense clause and gain access to advanced military equipment, training, and economic support. However, joining NATO would put us exclusively in the American camp and make us a direct target of the Soviet Union. Some in the cabinet also fear any future conflict would drag Turkey into a wider conflict. The pro-NATO cabinet members believe the organization are essential to securing Turkish independence and further modernizing the nation. They note the without NATO protection, the Soviets will only escalate their efforts to subvert Turkey. Opponents believe joining the organization steers the country away from the Kemalist foreign policy which benefitted the republic for decades and risk dragging Turkey into a devastating war in the future. A decision must be made."
nato_expansion.4.d:0 "Turkey announced its intention to join NATO. The announcement is seen as a major victory for the organization and brings the organization directly to the Soviet border. NATO members are said to be thrilled with the inclusion of a frontline state with a sizeable military and strategic, geographic value. NATO welcomed the decision and promised the organization would protect Turkey and help its people achieve prosperity and cooperation within the organization. The Soviet Union is said to be infuriated and have expressed concerns that the United States will soon establish bases from which to target the Soviet people. The Turkish government hopes membership will bring it access to greater military and economic support."
nato_expansion.5.d:0 "Turkey announced its rejection of the offer for NATO membership. The Turkish government stated joining the organization would undermine decades of foreign policy and risk dragging the Turkish people into a war it has no interest in. The Soviet Union has welcomed the Turkish decision, calling it a responsible, neighborly decision. NATO and the United States in particular will be greatly disappointed for not gaining access to Turkish territory and its sizeable military."
nato_expansion.6.d:0 "NATO recently offered us membership to the organization. Joining NATO would bring us under their collective defense and allow us access to military, economic, and political support. The cabinet will have to debate whether to join or not. Those who believe we should join note we only recently survived an attempted communist takeover influenced by Soviet subversion. Being a part of NATO would give protection and accelerate our recovery from the fighting. The opposition claims Greece cannot rely on other states and by joining NATO it may only encourage more Soviet subversion. They believe Greece has suffered enough in recent years and joining the organization will risk it becoming embroiled in a future European war."
nato_expansion.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Greece announced the government had agreed to join NATO. This makes Greece the newest member of the American-backed alliance. The Greek government noted it looked forward to establishing close bonds with all member states and secure the protection of Greece from any outside threat. The NATO members are thrilled with the announcement, with the Americans interested in potentially establishing bases and facilities to better monitor Soviet actions in the eastern Mediterranean. The Soviets are said to be furious and have lodged a protest to the Greek ambassador in Moscow. Many in Greece are said to welcome the news as it would offer direct protection for a nation that was only recently the target of foreign invaders and then civil war."
nato_expansion.8.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Greece announced the government had rejected an offer to join NATO. The news will be seen as a blow to the organization which hoped to solidify its presence in the eastern Mediterranean and block Soviet influence. The Soviet Union praised the decision as one meant to lower tension in the world. The Greek government stated it rejected joining the group because the Greek people were still recovering and are in no condition to take on the responsibilities of joining a military alliance. Whether this rejection is a sign of Greek neutrality or a shift towards the Soviet camp, only  time will tell."
nato_expansion.9.d:0 "As American, British, and French forces plan to formally end their military occupation of our country, they have offered us membership to join NATO. Joining the organization will finalize our integration into the defense of Western Europe. The Americans in particular believe our membership to NATO is crucial to prevent future Soviet aggression. Joining the organization will aid the remilitarization of our country and allow us to demonstrate that Germany is a power for democracy and freedom in Europe. However, some in the cabinet are urging us to reject the proposal, they note France and Britain are reluctant to see us rearm, which may cause tensions. More importantly, they worry our joining NATO will make reunification virtually impossible as the Soviets will see us as a American client."
nato_expansion.10.d:0 "West Germany formally accepted an invitation to join NATO. This marks a major victory for the organization. News of the announcement was coolly received in London and Paris as many there are suspicious of a rearmed Germany, even as an ally. The United States however, warmly welcomed the news, calling it proof that Germany was rehabilitated and was a willing partner to democracy. For NATO planners, West Germany greatly strengthens the defense of Western Europe both in terms of adding military power but also strategic territory. The Soviet Union is said to be infuriated by the announcement, accusing the United States and NATO of sabotaging any hopes for German reunification and European peace."
nato_expansion.11.d:0 "In a surprise announcement, West Germany rejected NATO membership. This is a major blow for the organization which counted on West Germany becoming a key frontline state for the defense of Western Europe. France and Britain do not appear too publicly disturbed by this direction as many in those countries feared what would happen if NATO rearmed West Germany, even as an ally. The United States is said to be greatly disappointed as it most strongly lobbied for West Germany to join the organization. Many American officials expressed concern the German rejection indicates they may be falling under false Soviet promises of supporting a unified, neutral Germany. The Soviet Union responded positively to the news, praising West Germany for reducing the threat of another European war."
nato_expansion.12.d:0 "As we work to solidify our control of the nation and prevent a communist resurgence, NATO has offered us membership to the organization. Joining NATO would give us access to crucial military, economic, and training support. It would also offer us protection under its collective security clause, protecting us from foreign communist invasion. It may be the shield behind which we build a strong Albania. However, joining the organization may only cause the communists to expand their subversion efforts and raise domestic unrest. NATO would also make us obligated to host foreign troops and join conflicts the Albanian people have no interest in. We must decide if the benefits outweigh the negatives."
nato_expansion.13.d:0 "The Kingdom of Albania indicated it would join NATO as soon as possible. The Albanian government noted its historical ties with member states and its desire to more deeply cement those ties. NATO members are said to be thrilled with the news, many seeing Albania as a key frontline state and a base from which to challenge communist regimes in the Balkans. More importantly, NATO believes it can now protect Albania from direct communist action. The Soviet Union is said to be furious and has long accused the Albanian government of being a American puppet that illegally seized power, noting the Albanian people will not tolerate such oppression for long."
nato_expansion.14.d:0 "The Kingdom of Albania indicated it would not join NATO despite the offer of membership. The organization will be bitterly disappointed as many felt Albanian membership would offer protection to the nation and allow NATO to establish a powerful presence in the Balkans. It appears the Albanians feared joining the organization, would not protect the Kingdom, but instead risk an immediate communist invasion or popular uprising. The new regime is still establishing itself and uprooting the Albanian communist structures. The Albanian government added that though it would not join the organization, it hoped to maintain friendly ties with all NATO member states."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.0.d:0 "The Secretary of State for the United States pledged it will soon bring the recent crisis to the Security Council and General Assembly for discussion. The Americans argue the popular uprising and Soviet intervention indicate the situation may soon escalate into open warfare and even civil war. It is hoped the Security Council could raise awareness to what is occurring in Hungary and condemn the suppression of its people. Many observers believe the American move will be largely symbolic as the Soviet Union controls a veto vote in the Security Council and is unlikely to support anything contrary to its interests."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.1.d:0 "The situation in Hungary is critical. A successful uprising has removed the puppet Soviet communist leadership and the new regime in Budapest indicated its intentions to establish a more independent, and democratic regime. The Soviet Union has responded with an armed intervention, leading to intense street fighting between Hungarian revolutionaries and Soviet tanks. The United States has two options at the United Nations, we can propose a vote to the General Assembly, which will pass, that condemns the Soviet action and call for a full investigation. Which would be a major symbolic victory, or we could propose a United Nations Police Action at the Security Council, though to get it passed we would need to cooperate with the Soviets."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.10.d:0 "The United States has directed its foreign missions and top officials to condemn the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The American government cannot sit idly as Soviet tanks trample the rights and dreams of the Hungarian people. The American action appears to be limited to words at the moment, but its strong, public criticism will raise international awareness on the issue. The Soviet Union and its allies have responded by accusing the United States of hypocrisy, noting its lack of criticism when the rights of citizens in states allied to the United States are trampled on."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.11.d:0 "The United States has proposed a United Nations Police Action to separate the Hungarian revolutionary forces and Soviet troops in Hungary. The American government argues the UN must intervene to ensure the protection and safety of the Hungarian people as well as guarantee their rights are respected. The United States wishes to find a tangible solution to the issue so has directed its top diplomats to approach the Soviet diplomats in order to come up with an acceptable resolution to the matter. Regardless, it will be a tough battle."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.2.d:0 "The United States proposed a resolution in the General Assembly calling for the Soviet Union to halt its intervention in Hungary. The resolution also urges the Secretary General to launch a full investigation into the intervention and determine what happened. The resolution passed with an overwhelming majority as some of the Soviets socialist allies chose to abstain to indicate their own disapproval of what they see as a heavy-handed Soviet response. Although the United States is congratulating itself for its success, many newspapers and Hungarian exiles note the resolution is largely symbolic."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.3.d:0 "The United States has approached us on their plan for introducing a resolution calling for a United Nations police action in Hungary. The American government notes the situation in Hungary is tense and at risk of spiraling out of control. On top of that there is wide international backlash to our actions. They propose that we support the deployment of United Nations forces to ensure a ceasefire and peaceful negotiation can occur to end the conflict. We insisted any UN force must work to disarm Hungarian rebels and must have Soviet observers to ensure their neutrality, the Americans agreed. One faction in Moscow believes supporting the resolution will restore Soviet prestige and negotiations are likely to succeed in keeping Hungary socialist. However, another faction believes we cannot trust the West and are on the verge of victory. We should use our veto power to reject the proposal."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.4.d:0 "The United States presented a resolution calling for the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Hungary. These forces would separate the hostile powers, disarm civilian militias and other armed groups, while ensuring a peaceful environment for negotiations between the Hungarian parties and Moscow. The Soviet Union was unimpressed, even with offers to be included in the UN mission. The Soviet ambassador lambasted the United States delegation and its hypocritic reaction to events in Hungary. It termed the issue a matter for the Hungarian people and that Soviet forces were keeping the peace already, at the invitation of the government. The Soviet Union went on to veto the resolution, ending any chance of its passing and sending a diplomatic defeat to the United States."
Hungarian_Rev_UN.5.d:0 "The United States presented a resolution calling for the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers to Hungary. These forces would separate the hostile powers, disarm civilian militias and other armed groups, while ensuring a peaceful environment for negotiations between the Hungarian parties and Moscow. The Soviet delegation responded positively, noting that its forces were already in the country on the invitation of the Hungarian delegation. It noted UN forces could help support the peacekeeping mission in place and provide greater transparency to the positive role the Soviet Union was playing to resolve the conflict. The Security Council then voted to approve the resolution. The United States views the resolution as a great victory. Analysts also believe, that despite the Soviet acceptance, the resolution represents a recognition by the Soviets that the situation was not being easily resolved through brute military force and it needed to change tact."
USA_FRAIND.1.d:0 "The United States has called for our forces to withdraw from Indochina. They are concerned over the intensifying conflict in the region, including the siege of Dien Bien Phu. The Americans insist we do not have the credibility, firepower, or political will to achieve a victory. They insist our continued operations only risk further strengthening Vietnamese support for the communists. However, our top military and intelligence officials are calling us to refuse the demand, especially after the success of Operation Condor, which gravely weakened communist supply lines and infrastructure. The generals are confidant with a little more effort, victory can be achieved. The Foreign Minister is not as optimistic and warns if we refuse the Americans, they may choose to cut off aid to France, which could cripple the economy."
USA_FRAIND.2.d:0 "France indicated it agrees with our call for their withdrawal from Indochina. The French government stated it recognizes the situation on the ground is untenable and it will soon begin the process of opening talks with all relevant parties and preparing for a withdrawal of its forces. This is a major diplomatic victory as the CIA and State Department were growing increasingly worried that continued French occupation would strengthen the credibility of communists and weaken anti-communist or pro-Western factions among the Vietnamese people."
USA_FRAIND.3.d:0 "France has rejected our call for their withdrawal from Indochina. The French argued that due to recent successes on the ground, it could not halt its operations or withdraw while in a position of strength. The French emphasized that a withdrawal at this stage would abandon those people in the region who support them and enable a power vacuum the communists will exploit to their advantage. The continued French stubbornness continues to alienate regional states and Western reputation abroad, we may have to consider more harsh measures to bring the French to their senses."
Establish_SEATO.1.d:0 "During a Council of Ministers meeting in Bangkok, the Southeast Asia Treaty Association (SEATO) was formally established. The organization is a consequence of the recently signed Manilla Pact which called for its signatories to form SEATO in order to bolster bilateral ties and encourage collective security in the face of increasing regional communist aggression. The organization will be headquartered in Bangkok and hopes to attract more anti-communist regional states. The United States are major supporters of the effort and expressed hopes for the organization to emerge as a regional NATO. Although plans for cultural and military exchanges were discussed, the meeting did not agree on establishing any joint military commands. The Chinese government expressed reservations about the organization, calling it a pointless imperialist attempt to destroy the Chinese revolution."
Establish_SEATO.2.d:0 "The United States has offered us membership to SEATO. The organization is meant to strengthen bilateral ties between member states and coordinate collective security against Chinese aggression in the region. Joining the organization will provide opportunities to expand relations with those states, especially trade ties and cultural exchanges. Militarily, the organization does not have joint military commands but does hold regular meetings with senior defense officials which could give our armed forces professional development. However, joining the organization may make us a target of communist states. Our own domestic population may not be comfortable with the idea of collective security and oppose potential efforts to integrate the military responses of the group."
Establish_SEATO.3.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has accepted our invitation to join SEATO. They have pledged to attend the next Council of Ministers meeting to formalize its membership. They have informed us the organization aligns with their foreign policy and objectives. They were particularly excited about the prospect of increasing cultural and trade ties with the other member states. This is a major victory for our foreign policy and SEATO will benefit from its newest member. The response from the press is very positive as many in the country see the growth of SEATO as confirmation of our robust foreign policy."
Establish_SEATO.4.d:0 "[FROM.GetName] has declined our invitation to join SEATO. They claim discomfort over the prospect of being so closely linked with the organization along with domestic concerns. It was iterated that the rejection of membership did not mean a rejection of our position or friendship. [FROM.GetName] has determined joining the organization would potentially cause more problems than benefits. This is a setback for sure, but we will continue to look for potential new members to strengthen the defense against the looming threat of communism in Asia."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.1.d:0 "The United States recently proposed expanding the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is designed to contain communist influence in the middle east. Its members enjoy increased bilateral ties and better access to Western aid. The American proposal would seek to bring in more middle east states and strengthen CENTO to face not just communist threats but also other radical ideologies in the region. Its legitimacy as a regional alliance would be strengthened. Pro-American Arab states will be targeted to bring more Arab states to the organization. Bringing more Arab state will also quash accusations the organization is not representative of the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.2.d:0 "We recently received an invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is meant to be a middle east version of NATO and prevent communist expansion in the region. The United State and Britain provide military and economic aid to the group. Members enjoy increased bilateral and cultural ties. Joining the organization could increase access to Western aid. It would solidify our place in the Western camp. However, joining the organization could have domestic ramifications and radicalize both leftists and Arab nationalist in the country."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.3.d:0 "The Lebanese government has declined membership to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Lebanon stated they respected the invitation and carefully considered it. However, due to domestic concerns and the feelings of the Lebanese people, it must decline. This is a major blow for the United States which hopes to expand CENTO in order to bring more Arab states to better respond to radical ideological threat to the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.4.d:0 "The Lebanese government announced its excitement to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Joining the organization will bring Lebanon access to more Western aid. Lebanon expressed its hopes of expanding bilateral and cultural ties with all member states. CENTO and the United States view this as a major victory, Lebanon brings one of the largest centers of Arab culture in the organization, providing CENTO greater legitimacy in the region. Arab states in the region are condemning Lebanon and accusing it of betraying the Arab people for an imperial puppet alliance."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.5.d:0 "Lebanon responded positively to the invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). This is a great victory for the organization which we helped setup in order to contain communist influence in the region. Though the organization was meant to promote collective defense in the region but has not really gotten beyond being a forum for closer bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges. With Lebanon joining the organization, it will quiet regional criticism of the group being an imperial project promoted by us and Britain. It will also give the organization a stronger ability to deal with the rise of more radical ideologies in the region, like Arab nationalism."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.6.d:0 "We recently received an invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). CENTO is meant to be a middle east version of NATO and prevent communist expansion in the region. Britain and the United States provide military and economic aid to the group. Members enjoy increased bilateral and cultural ties. Joining the organization could increase access to Western aid. It would solidify our place in the Western camp. It could strengthen the pro-Western inclinations of the monarchy, however it could backfire and radicalize both leftists and Arab nationalist in the country, especially in the military."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.7.d:0 "The Jordanian government has declined membership to the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Jordan stated they respected the invitation and carefully considered it. However, due to domestic concerns and the feelings of the Jordanian people, it must decline. This is a major blow for the United States which hopes to expand CENTO in order to bring more Arab states to better respond to radical ideological threat to the region. For Jordan, it will likely strengthen its image among Arab nationalists both domestically and in the region."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.8.d:0 "The Jordanian government announced its excitement to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Joining the organization will bring Jordan greater access to more Western aid. Jordan expressed its hopes of expanding bilateral and cultural ties with all member states. CENTO and the United States view this as a major victory, Jordan brings one of the more influential Arab states in the organization, giving CENTO greater legitimacy. Arab states in the region are condemning Jordan and accusing it of betraying the Arab people for an imperial puppet alliance and bribes."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.9.d:0 "Jordan responded positively to the invitation to join the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). This is a great victory for the organization which we helped setup in order to contain communist influence in the region. Though the organization was meant to promote collective defense in the region but has not really gotten beyond being a forum for closer bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges. With Jordan joining the organization, it will quiet regional criticism of the group being an imperial project promoted by us and Britain. It will also give the organization a stronger ability to deal with the rise of more radical ideologies in the region, like Arab nationalism."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.10.d:0 "The United States accepted an invitation to officially join Central Treaty Organization (CENTO) and no longer be an observer. This gives the organization much greater access to Western aid and reduces the burden on Britain to meet the needs of CENTO. The CENTO members are said to be thrilled with the announcement and look forward to hosting senior American officials in future conferences. For the United States, a strong CENTO will protect its interests in the region and provide it a strong alliance to combat anti-Western or communist-friendly regimes. Critics in the region are condemning the action, calling it proof that CENTO is an imperial project. Joining the organization will lessen the need to support Israel directly to achieve our objectives. Our membership may help transform the organization into a true NATO for the middle east."
CENTO_PROPOSAL.11.d:0 "The United States has declined an invitation to upgrade its status from an observer to a member of the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO). Although the organization is meant to defend the middle east from communist encroachment, it has struggled to evolve beyond a forum of bilateral, cultural, and military exchanges among members. In the wider middle east, the organization is seen as an imperial project. The State Department is not confident our membership will evolve the group and in fact worry it will further erode its legitimacy in the region. Israel has also not been particularly fond of the group and pro-Israeli officials note supporting Israel will be a far more effective way to achieve regional objectives. For these reasons, the United States decided not to join."

CIA_SYRIA.1.d:0 "Recently the CIA held talks with a former Syrian minister, Michail Bey Ilyan, over the prospect of an anti-communist coup in the country by the military. He stated that military units could seize control of Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, and Hamah along with all major international border crossings. Once radio stations announced a new government, under Colonel Kabbani, the leading anti-communist civilian politicians would be called to serve the new government. The plotters would need cash from the CIA to pay off relevant officers and ensure success. The CIA supports the plan, calling it Operation Straggle, they believe an anti-communist Syria would shore up anti-Soviet resistance in the region. Diplomatic advisors are not supportive, believing the operation may enflame tensions and cause instability in Damascus, which the communists could then exploit."
CIA_SYRIA.2.d:0 "CIA agents in Damascus have worked furiously to ensure the relevant cash drops were made to support Operation Straggle. Over a hundred thousand dollars has been spread in support of Straggle. The State Department is prepared to release statements and diplomatic maneuvers to protect and support the new regime following the coup. However, tensions in the region with Israel forced the Syrian orchestrator, Michail Bey Ilyan to postpone the plan for five days. The CIA is urging Ilyan to not delay any further as the moment may be lost. Washington is waiting nervously to see if the planned coup occurs."
CIA_SYRIA.3.d:0 "Reports from Damascus are sketchy, Syrian military vehicles were spotted moving across the city, securing key buildings and the state radio station. Similar reports have arrived from Aleppo. Travelers trying to enter or leave Syria from either the Jordanian or Lebanese border are being forced to turn around as the military appears to have closed the borders. Radio broadcasts are declaring a new government will be forming under Colonel Kabbani, indicating a coup is occurring. The next few hours will determine exactly has occurred in Syria overnight."
CIA_SYRIA.4.d:0 "The Syrian government announced plans for a coup sponsored by the United States had been uncovered by Syrian intelligence. Syria released pictures of arrested conspirators and showed the assembled media piles of cash said to be provided by the CIA. The Syrians claim it was patriotic officers who turned the conspirators in and halted the American attempt to rob the Syrian people of their independence. The United States has denied involvement in any plot. The coup apparently envisioned the Syrian military overthrowing the government and establish a new regime around Colonel Kabbani, who is among the detained."
CIA_SYRIA.5.d:0 "The new regime of Colonel Kabbani is already enjoying international legitimacy, especially from the United States which was quick to recognize his government and push its allies to do the same. The American embassy has also been active, with rumors that senior officers are being paid cash to not challenge the new regime. The recent announcement of a new cabinet, consisting of anti-communist politicians has further confirmed what many Syrians understood from the beginning. This coup is a CIA-sponsored operation. The new regime will have to work quickly to establish itself among the people as many Syrians view the regime with contempt."
CIA_SYRIA.6.d:0 "Our intelligence interrogations reveal the extent of American involvement in the recently uncovered coup plot. It appears senior American agents plotted and passed huge amounts of cash right under our noses. American support was based almost solely on the promise the new regime would be firmly anti-communist. It is distressing to see how far the United States would go in their plots, but fortunately, their allies were spineless and incompetent to our own agents. We will spread word of this American plot and the Syrian people will rally behind us as true defenders of the Syrian people."
CIA_SYRIA.7.d:0 "The failure of Operation Straggle reveals fundamental issues with American involvement in Syria. The CIA recognizes it was over trusting of its Syrian contacts and overvalued their capabilities. The Syrian intelligence apparatus is incredibly robust and difficult to outmaneuver. In addition, Syrian nationalism is a very powerful force, and the CIA thought cash bribes would overcome such loyalty. They were wrong as once officers realized where the money came from, they moved quickly to expose the plot. Incredibly, some officers we bribed went to the government, confessed, and turned over the cash. The exposure of our involvement also greatly weakens American prestige in the country and continued involvement will only stoke Syrian paranoia of the West. We must focus our efforts to overt diplomacy and engagement with friends in Syria instead of covert options. If not, we risk more failures like Operation Straggle."
CIA_SYRIA.99.d:0 "The CIA has used its contacts with media across the world and political allies to release articles highlighting how unstable the Syrian government is. These reports note the Syrian government remains committed to war with Israel and is engaged in arms building at the expense of developing its economy and government for the benefit of its people. More significantly, Congress has been informed of intelligence reports indicating growing communist power in Damascus. These reports suggest either a communist coup may occur in the near future or the unstable Syrian regime may turn to the Soviet Union, opening its lands to communist military bases and troops in exchange for arms. The public is increasingly viewing Syria as an unstable bomb on the verge of destroying any semblance of regional or global peace."
CIA_SYRIA.100.d:0 "The American government has invited us to join their international coalition against the Syrian government. The Americans claim the Syrian government is unstable and that It is bent on expansionism. Whether at the expense of its public enemies or Arab neighbors. On top of that, the Syrians continue to maintain territorial claims on almost all its neighbors. The United States would like us to help them end the Syrian regime to restore peace in the region and end the recent history of political instability in the country. Our advisors believe participating may open up opportunities with the Americans. However, a number of officials caution us to reject as joining the anti-Syria coalition may alienate our population who will likely see the war as an American adventure."
CIA_SYRIA.101.d:0 "The United States announced its coalition has commenced military operations against Syria. The Americans insist the Syrian government is unstable and a risk to its own population and all its neighbors. Disarming the regime and installing a government for all Syrians is the only way to prevent a catastrophic regional crisis from emerging. The United States promises a swift coalition campaign, but the Syrian government remains defiant and calls on all Syrians to unite in opposition to the foreign invaders."
CIA_SYRIA.25.d:0 "The United States has called for an international effort to provide humanitarian aid to Turkey. Recent unrest in northern Syria has seen large numbers of refugees cross the border into Turkey. The Turkish government recently called the situation on its border a humanitarian disaster. Turkish troops have deployed in the region to control the flow of refugees and support refugee camp construction. The American government also levied heavy criticism on the Syrian government for its heavy handed approach."
Syria_CIA.27.d:0 "The Secretary of State stated the United States recognized the recent annexation of northern Syria by Turkey. The Secretary noted Turkey was forced to act only after the Syrian government exasperated the situation with a brutal crackdown of civilians in the area. The United States believes the arrival of Turkish forces will halt the violence and prevent the situation from deteriorating further. The Syrian government has condemned the United States for undermining its sovereignty and openly backing the dismemberment of the Syrian nation. Syria calls on all Arabs to come together and liberate Arab lands seized by the Turks."
Syria_CIA.26.d:0 "Turkey recently asked for our reaction if they were to intervene in Syria. The Turkish government noted the humanitarian situation in northern Syria was rapidly deteriorating, causing a refugee crisis and bringing armed fighting right on their border. The Turkish military believes it can swiftly intervene and end the brutal Syrian campaign. The American President responded by endorsing such an intervention, the United States believes the conduct of Syrian forces, so they are unfit to govern the territory. The American government will provide Turkey all diplomatic and intelligence support it can for its operations."
CIA_SYRIA.50.d:0 "The United States has dispatched some envoys to privately ask for our views on Syria and a plan they have developed. The Americans believe northern Syria is unhappy with Damascus and their agents can foment an uprising. In the ensuring chaos, the Americans would ask us to intervene and occupy northern Syria with full support and international protection from the United States. With American backing, such a plot could see us in control of strategic territory and resources. However, any military operation comes with unforeseen risks and we may risk facing stiffer Syrian resistance or a wider Arab backlash if we go along with the American plan. We must make our decision on whether to support the scheme to invade northern Syria or decline."
CIA_SYRIA.51.d:0 "Turkey has indicated it is willing to work with the United States on a plan to deal with the Syrian regime. They have promised to deploy forces and help build the case for a Turkish intervention once the uprising in northern Syria began. Turkey also pledged to share its own intelligence and assets in the region to aid the American effort. This is a major diplomatic victory. Once Turkey takes over the Syrian territory, Syria will be reduced to a rump state and will no longer pose a threat to the region."
CIA_SYRIA.52.d:0 "The Turkish government has declined to support plans with the United States to instigate a popular uprising in northern Syria to setup a Turkish takeover of the area. The Turks believe the plan is not realistic and would weaken the regional position of Turkey and risk a prolonged, bloody conflict with Syria. This is a major setback for American plans to weaken the Syria and remove them as a regional threat. The Turkish government also noted though it would not support the plan, it hopes to maintain friendly ties with the United States."
CIA_SYRIA.53.d:0 "The United States sent intelligence operatives to privately present our government with a proposal. They believe the Syrian government and state poses a risk to regional security and American interests. They would want us to launch an invasion of Syria and restore Hashemite rule the area. To support the endeavor, they will provide extensive diplomatic cover and provide military arms to our forces. Their intelligence agencies will also aid in establishing a pretext for an Iraqi intervention. The plan is attractive in that it would right the wrongs endured by the late King Faisal and firmly establish our place in the region. However, many advisors fear such an intervention could alienate the Iraqi people and Arab nationalists in the military. We must decide how to respond."
CIA_SYRIA.54.d:0 "The Iraqi government has agreed to support our plans for overthrowing the Syrian government. The Iraqi government and intelligence agencies will cooperate with ours to facilitate the transfer of arms and a pretext for an Iraqi advance into Syria. The Iraqis are very attracted to the idea of expanding Hashemite rule in Syria and curtailing the spread of Arab nationalist ideas. They are adamant the pretext be made undeniable in order to strengthen the government when it decides to intervene. American diplomatic and clandestine support is also greatly appreciated. The plan will hopefully end the Syrian threat once and for all."
CIA_SYRIA.55.d:0 "The Iraqi government declined to support our plan for overthrowing the Syrian government. The Iraqis believe the scheme is not realistic and its potential rewards do not outweigh the potential negative outcomes. The Iraqis fear a prolonged conflict with a fellow Arab state. However, the biggest concern is that even with a strong pretext established, Arab nationalists in Iraq and the military may instead use the conflict to seize power from the monarchy. The Iraqi decision is a major setback to American efforts to deal with Syria and the risks it poses to the region."
CIA_SYRIA.10.d:0 "The CIA initiated contact with senior Syrian right-wing generals, under the leadership of General Adib Shishakli. He has a history of being friendly with the West and promises a return to such policies along with a crackdown of Syrian communists. Our Syrian friends believe a coup can be done but for a price. Syrian commanders, troops, and officials will have to be bribed to ensure support for the proposed coup. The CIA is confident the plan will work as General Shishakli has national recognition and experience at the highest levels. The proposed operation is being called Operation Wappen."
CIA_SYRIA.11.d:0 "The CIA has presented the final plan for Operation Wappen. The Syrian generals have asked for much more cash than originally agreed upon The White House is concerned throwing so much cash in Damascus may expose the plan and hints that this may just be an attempt to extort us. Of more concern is that this is a Syrian sting operation meant to expose our involvement and damage our reputation in the region. The CIA is strongly encouraging we meet the demands, but the Secretary of State believes they are suffering from tunnel vision and desperation to engineer a regime change. We must decide to meet the exorbitant demand, offer the original amount, or cut our losses and not risk exposure."
Passage_to_Freedom.0.d:0 "The United States Navy announced the initiation of Operation Passage to Freedom. American forces will help the French Army and French Navy evacuate pro-French and anti-communist Vietnamese civilians trapped in communist North Vietnam to the safety of non-communist South Vietnam. In particular, the campaign is focusing on evacuating Catholics in North Vietnam who face the threat of an atheistic regime and hostile propaganda that they are a pro-French fifth column. The CIA is secretly working with the South Vietnamese government to produce and spread leaflets in North Vietnam urging Catholics and others to flee the communist regime. The current government in South Vietnam desperately wishes to bring more Catholics to bolster a government heavily reliant on Catholic officials. North Vietnam has condemned what they call hostile propaganda, though there are reports of river traffic, roads, and villages being cut off from major cities to block the flow of refugees."
CIA_SYRIA.12.d:0 "The CIA has successfully dispersed cash bribes to key Syrian generals and it appears Operation Wappen is ready to go. The coup leader, General Shishakli is said to be organizing right wing political parties to prepare them in anticipation for the coup. Once the generals seize power and purge leftist officers, the new government will need the support of the right-wing parties to successfully govern. The CIA reported its confidence to the White House that the Operation will occur soon. It also noted the successful bribery campaign indicated American economic power can be effectively used to achieve intelligence objectives, when the situation was right."
CIA_SYRIA.13.d:0 "The CIA suffered a major setback following news reports from Damascus that several Syrian generals had turned in bribe money they claimed was given by the United States to launch a coup. Syrian forces surrounded our embassy and detained the CIA officer orchestrating the plot on the ground. The generals claimed their patriotism and loyalty to Syria pushed them to report the incident and turn in the cash. Operation Wappen has been exposed, along with CIA participation. Other Syrian generals and political leaders involved either fled abroad or were detained by Syrian intelligence. It appears our bribe offers were not high enough for several generals who chose to expose the plot rather than risk a failed coup. The White House is said to be furious while the State Department suggests that Syrian intelligence had known the entire time and only struck now to maximize the embarrassment for the United States."
CIA_SYRIA.14.d:0 "Overnight, Syrian tanks and troops swarmed across Damascus, seizing the radio station along with key government buildings. Similar scenes occurred in Aleppo and several other major Syrian cities. The next morning, state radio broadcasted that a council of generals had seized power and overthrown the government for its corruption and betrayals of the Syrian people. By that evening, the exiled General Shishakli arrived by plane to take control of the junta and government. The new Syrian leader addressed the population and called for national unity and a purging of dangerous, foreign ideologies like communism from the country. The United States and Britain were quick to welcome the new government, while Arab nationalists in other parts of the region staged protests."
Syria_CIA.10.d:0 "The United States announced it was commencing military operations against the Syrian government. In recent weeks, the CIA has used its media contacts to publish reports linking massive Soviet arms transfers to Syria. They also wrote articles describing the Syrian government as a Soviet client fomenting unrest in the region and brutally repressing the people. This has led to public outcry and a demand for action to halt Syrian aggression in the region. The President stated the American armed forces would act to liberate the Syrian people."
CIA_SYRIA.59.d:0 "Turkish forces have crossed the border into northern Syria. The Turkish government claims the recent escalation of violence and growing refugee crisis has forced it to act. The Syrian government is being accused of using excessive force and violence against rebels in northern Syria. The Syrian government denounced what they call an invasion from Turkey and have pledged to drive off any invading army. The United States stated its support of Turkey, calling it a humanitarian action meant to stop the unrest in the region."
CIA_SYRIA.60.d:0 "The Turkish government announced it has established a safe zone under direct Turkish administration in northern Syria. This follows its intervention in the region to drive off Syrian government forces who it accused of committing human rights abuses against the northern Syrian people. The Syrian government was quick to condemn this apparent annexation of its territory and calls on the Arab world to condemn and resist the Turkish invasion. The United States supports the Turkish decision, noting the stabilizing presence Turkey has in the region."
CIA_SYRIA.61.d:0 "Thousands of Syrians took to the streets of Damascus to celebrate the recent victory of its forces over Turkey. The Turkish military recently attempted to intervene in northern Syria to stop Syrian government forces from targeting rebels in the region. However, the Turkish force was soon halted by the Syrian military which launched a successful counterattack. Reports indicate the Syrian military is in control of Hatay, a historically disputed territory. The Syrian government released a statement saying it had liberated the final Arab cities under Ottoman Turkish bondage. Many observers believe the United States will likely be embarrassed by the failure of its ally Turkey and may need to reassess its engagement with Syria."
CIA_SYRIA.56.d:0 "Reports indicate that Iraqi forces have crossed into Syria in large numbers. Details are sketchy but it appears the Hashemite King of Iraq has intervened in order to restore the Syrian monarchy and his family on the throne. The Iraqi government claimed it was forced to act in order to save the Syrian people from oppression and corruption. The Syrian government condemned the Iraqi intervention, terming it a colonial invasion by traitors to the Arab World. The Syrian military is said to be rapidly deploying to face the threat. The United States is accused of encouraging the Iraqi government to act."
CIA_SYRIA.57.d:0 "Victorious Iraqi troops, copying the victory parade of King Faisal in 1918, marched through Damascus. The Iraqi government claimed it had successfully defeated a corrupt and illegitimate regime and would restore a legitimate royal authority for the Syrian people. Syrian government forces failed to stop the Iraqi intervention, which is being widely condemned by Arab nationalists across the region. The United States is said to be very satisfied with the new regime change in Damascus and offered its congratulations to the Iraqi government."
CIA_SYRIA.58.d:0 "Captured Iraqi vehicles and trucks full of captured arms and destroyed equipment was paraded through Damascus. The Syrian government was showing off the spoils of its successful defeat of invading Iraqi forces. The Iraqi military recently intervened in Syria to restore the Hashemite monarchy, but its efforts ended in failure. The Iraqi government remains quiet about what happened, though reports clearly indicate a Syrian victory. The Syrian government insists its victory is for the entire Arab World against Western imperialism. The Iraqi government will need to assess what went wrong. The United States is said to be bitterly disappointed with the performance of Iraqi forces and government."
USA_INDONESIA.5.d:0 "The situation in Indonesia has deteriorated as many patriotic Indonesians in Sumatra continue to oppose the government for its communist leanings. The government of Sukarno continues a heavy handed approach including cutting off essential supplies for those it accuses of rebelling. Under the advice of the CIA, the President has directed the State Department and United Nations mission to launch a diplomatic and public campaign calling for a humanitarian intervention in the conflict to prevent a massive loss of life. The CIA believes such a mission can provide an opportunity for us to expand contacts with the anti-communists and lay the groundwork for future action."
USA_INDONESIA.6.d:0 "The CIA recently dispatched obscured bombers piloted by former Air Force pilots through a front organization called Civil Air Transport to support the Sumatra anti-communist rebels against the Indonesian government. These pilots were covertly launching bombing runs against Indonesian positions from rebel-controlled airfields. Unfortunately, the Indonesians shot down a bomber piloted by Allen Lawrence Pope. His B-26, after a bombing run was intercepted and shot down. Pope and a rebel crewmember managed to bail out but were captured by Indonesian forces. His capture confirms accusations by the government that rebel planes are being flown by American and Nationalist Chinese planes. We are denying involvement and claiming Pope was a mercenary, but the incident is a major embarrassment and we will end the operation."
USA_INDONESIA.7.d:0 "Our operation in Indonesia ended in failure, the anti-communist Sumatra rebels were defeated and Sukarno now appears to be in a much stronger position. The reasons for this failure are many, for one we underestimated the capabilities of the Indonesian military. Our efforts to support propaganda stations and rebel basis were thwarted by government attacks. The Indonesian military itself has many anti-communist officers and our actions risked turning them against us. The rebels and anti-communist factions were actually further divided by our actions to prop up the rebels, providing an opportunity to the communists to more closely align with the government. We also failed to shore up other Western powers and did not commit enough forces to ensure rebel success."
USA_INDONESIA.1.d:0 "The United States condemned the human rights situation in Sumatra both at the United Nations and White House. The American government accuses the Indonesian government of using extreme violence and starvation against the people of Sumatra. This marks an internationalization of the recent rebellion of anti-communist Indonesian military officers who have seized Sumatra. The rebels are demanding the Indonesian government dissolve itself and ensure the removal of all communist influence from the nation. The Indonesian government so far has maintained control over most of the armed forces and its leader, Sukarno denies any alliance with communists or human rights abuses. Instead he says the rebels are a cabal of disgruntled men demanding power at the expense of Indonesian democracy. The United States action is being viewed with grave concern by other powers who fear American involvement may escalate the crisis."
USA_INDONESIA.8.d:0 "The United States Navy has initiated large naval exercises off the coast of Indonesia and near Sumatra, where rebel forces are currently battling government troops. The United States has recently began criticizing the Indonesian government for its heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the rebels and refusing to listen to their demands. The rebels are demanding the Indonesian government, led by Sukarno, relinquish power and purge the communist party from any participation either in government or politics. The government denies excessive communist influence and accuses the rebels, consisting of military officers, of trying to undermine democracy to seize power. The American naval deployment and its criticism will only weaken the position of the Indonesian government and provide a strong show of support for the rebels."
INO_USA_WAR.1.d:0 "In an address to the nation, the President of the United States announced American military forces were immediately deploying in Indonesia to protect the Sumatra rebels. The President noted the Indonesian government was using extreme tactics to end the revolt, needlessly putting millions of civilian lives at risk. He also stated the Indonesian government was increasingly falling under the thrall of foreign communist influence and the American intervention would not only save lives but save democracy for the people of Indonesia. The Indonesian government responded furiously, claiming the Sumatra rebels were simply a puppet force for the American government and that all Indonesians would unite to defeat the invading Americans."
INO_USA_WAR.5.d:0 "The United States announced plans to partition Indonesia. The American government noted the current Indonesian state was far too diverse and spread out geographically to allow an effective central government. Such a system made it vulnerable to localized revolts and those living outside the main islands were prone to neglect from the center. With partition, all peoples on the islands will have access to a receptive government and no one island can impose its values or beliefs across all others simply because they control key state apparatuses. The decision is facing criticism among urban Indonesians, many of whom argue the partition plan will only provoke more conflict between the islands. Other argue the partition is really just a tool to ensure Indonesia never achieves its potential to become a major global player."
INO_USA_WAR.4.d:0 "With our successful intervention in Indonesia, we have the ability to dictate a resolution to the conflict. One option is to restore the central government and hand over power to the Sumatra rebel leader Colonel Ahmed Hussein. He will establish a strong regime and purge all communists from the country. Analysts believe his stance is popular among military officers. He could coordinate a robust, national anti-communist program. An alternative solution to Colonel Hussein is to partition Indonesia, as many analysts believe Indonesia is too large and geographically divided to be governed as it is currently. The unwieldly state apparatus makes Indonesia especially vulnerable to communist infiltration. Partition would prevent this and block a major avenue for communist infestation in the region."
INO_USA_WAR.6.d:0 "With American backing, Colonel Ahmed Hussein has solidified his control over Indonesia. Colonel Hussein came to prominence as one of the main rebel military officers in Sumatra. He delivered the ultimatum to the Indonesian government for the restoration of government officials and new elections. However, the government refused, resulting in an armed conflict. With American support, the rebels were able to triumph. He is expected to announce a cabinet consisting of the top national, anti-communist political leaders. His current military junta has several prominent and highly respected anti-communist officers. New elections are being promised, along with the banning of communists and other groups viewed as threats to the Indonesian state and democracy. The CIA and American embassy are reportedly playing a major role behind the scenes to protect the Hussein regime from counter-coups being planned by more senior officers."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.0.d:0 "The CIA, using a front company in Thailand has successfully been shifting bombers and pilots to support the Indonesian rebels in Sumatra. Our pilots have successfully been conducting strafing and bombing runs on Indonesian military targets and airfields. The bombers are slowly being transferred over to rebel pilots and it is clear our operations have not been exposed. We have managed to avoid exposure by the Indonesian government, allowing us to support the rebels and publicly remain a neutral party in the conflict. This will give us greater flexibility in pressuring Indonesia to stop its increasingly alignment with local communists."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.1.d:0 "The CIA, using a front company in Thailand, had tried to clandestinely provide bombers and pilots to rebels in Sumatra. However, the Indonesian government has managed to shoot down a bomber and capture a pilot, exposing their origin. This is a major embarrassment for our government and a failure for the CIA. The Indonesians are furious and our reputation in the region will suffer as a result. It will require a lot of effort to re-establish trust with Indonesia. Along with the Indonesian government, the Soviet Union and regional communist parties are gleefully publicizing our embarrassment. The CIA director was given a dressing down by the President."
INO_CIA_EXPOSURE.2.d:0 "The Indonesian government has released news that an American bomber, flying for rebel forces in Sumatra, was shot down while attacking a government military airfield. The American Embassy quickly declined any involvement, however, Indonesian newspapers published photos of the downed airplane and an American pilot being held in custody. The downed plane, a World War II American plane, had Republic of China symbols under a recently applied fresh coat of plane. The Indonesian government noted the captured pilot, and origin of the plane indicated direct involvement from the United States. The American government now insists any American planes or pilots involved were mercenaries, not representatives or agents of the United States. Despite its claims, most nations appear to be siding with Indonesia and are calling for the United States to halt any assistance it is giving to rebel forces."
Sumatran_Revolt.50.d:0 "Indonesian rebels in Sumatra, mostly military units, recently started a revolt demanding the Sukarno government stepdown. The rebels believe communist influence in Jakarta is growing and Sukarno is falling to their influence. Efforts by Sukarno to resolve the issues and prevent an escalation have had some early success. However, the CIA believes with its backing, it can bring more support for the rebels and turn the revolt into a full-scale uprising against Sukarno. This would gravely weaken Sukarno and ensure help ensure the communists do not manipulate their way to power."

Sumatran_Revolt.0.d:0 "Regional military commanders across Sumatra have stopped reporting or obeying to the central government and are essentially in revolt. There is rising concern over the economy and concern among some officers that the focus of the government is on Java and not the other islands. Loyal officers are often removed in bloodless coups by the rebel officers who then establish a new, alternative local government. There are rumors these officers are taking revenue and encouraging smuggling to raise funds. The government must figure out a proper response, although the rebellious officers claim they are not seeking to form a state within a state but to raise awareness of deficiencies in the government."
Sumatran_Revolt.1.d:0 "The rebellious Army officers in Sumatra recently held a conference and decided to unify under the leadership of Lt. Colonel Ahmad Hussein. They call themselves the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia and have issued an ultimatum to Jakarta. The group believes President Sukarno is under communist influence and he must curtail his power and return the Presidency to the powers invested in it by the constitution. The other demands call for the restoration of democratic rule under anti-communist political leaders. They have given the government five days to comply."
Sumatran_Revolt.2.d:0 "The demands issued by the rebellious military officers on Sumatra were accepted by President Sukarno. The rebel officers, who formed a group called the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) sought for the restoration of democratic institutions and removal of communists from the central government. As per the rebel demands, President Sukarno will limit his powers to what was constitutionally agreed and allow Djuanda Kartawidjaja to reform his cabinet and govern until new elections can be held. The victory of the PRRI leader, Lt. Colonel Ahmed Hussein, has propelled him to national celebrity and there are rumors he may harbor presidential ambitions during the new elections which will be held soon. Indonesian communists will be viewing these developments with anxiety."
Sumatran_Revolt.3.d:0 "President Sukarno dismissed the concerns and demands of the rebelling military officers in Sumatra and ordered the military to mobilize. He also called on all loyal citizens and soldiers to help the government restore order to Sumatra. The rebel officers, calling themselves the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) are under the leadership of Lt. Colonel Ahmed Hussein, responded with its own call for patriotic Indonesians to join their revolt. The PRRI claims the current government is too authoritarian and too tolerant of communists. The PRRI believes if it does not act now, the central government could soon become the victim of a communist coup. The bulk of Indonesian forces appear loyal to the government, however, it remains to be seen if that will change once fighting begins."
Sumatran_Revolt.4.d:0 "The Indonesian government declared it had crushed the rebellion of military officers in Sumatra. The rebel officers, who called themselves the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) started their uprising over fears of communist influence and a lack of democracy in the central government. The Indonesian government successfully marshalled its forces and convinced its loyal officers that the rebels were motivated more by greed. Indeed, the conflict revealed many Indonesian officers are ardent anti-communists, but they believed the rebel officers were exaggerating the communist threat or influence on President Sukarno. The Indonesian military simply overwhelmed the rebel forces whose withdrawals and guerilla tactics failed to stem the government forces. The PRRI leadership also fractured and soon its commanders were surrendering across the front."
Sumatran_Revolt.5.d:0 "Lt. Colonel Ahmed Hussein declared victory over the Indonesian government, bringing an end to the conflict between the government and the rebel forces based in Sumatra. The rebel group, the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) rose in revolt after the government refused its demands to limit communist influence and restore adherence to constitutional limits of power. The government refused and dispatched its forces to defeat the rebels. However, the PRRI managed to fight off government attacks and even convince many of their forces to defect. Ahmed Hussein has promised to restore Prime Minister Djuanda Kartawidjaja and his cabinet. Elections are to be held soon, though the PRRI is likely to ensure no communists can participate. Hussain is expected to assume the presidency until the elections."

Kennedy80.0.d:0 "Today from the White House, President Edward Kennedy announced the signing of an executive order placing a six month freeze on inflation. Previously ordered during the Second World War and by the Nixon Administration, this would entail freezing wages and prices for a six-month period, in an attempt to prevent prices from going up and from the gradual devaluation of the US dollar. While Kennedy mentioned "close consultation with the Federal Reserve and Department of Treasury," the Chairman of the Fed Paul Volcker and the Secretary of the Treasury, William Simon, could not be reached for comment immediately. Many pundits and leading economists approve of this, but some remain skeptical after the last attempt, which substantially did not help the problem. It will be a matter of time to see if this freeze actually works or not."
Kennedy80.1.d:0 "Today from the Oval Office, President Edward Kennedy announced his intention to begin immediate federal enforcement of the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, by all executive departments and agencies. Passed previously but never enforced, the Act stipulated that the federal government have a balanced budget, balanced trade, and ensure full employment, price stability, and growth in production, including setting numerical goals for unemployment rate, growth, and balance. Kennedy stated in his address that all federal departments and agencies will have 60 days to submit an action plan to him outlining their plans to enforce the Act, with particular emphasis on how the Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and Council of Economic Advisors tackle the issue. Many average Americans see this announcement as nothing more than another promise for the moment, as this legislation seems nearly impossible to enforce, but optimism is high, for the moment."
Kennedy88.1.d:0 "Since being elected to office, Edward Kennedy has spurred what many political historians are calling the "Return to Camelot," playing off of his famous, late brother’s Camelot administration in the early 1960s. In the eight short years since Teddy Kennedy was elected to office, much has been accomplished. In the economic sphere, Kennedy declared a six month freeze on inflation, began the massive enforcement of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, signed the Revenue Adjustment Act of 1984, increased the minimum wage massively, and began yet more tax reform. On the social side, President Kennedy was chiefly responsible for fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, as well as legalizing sodomy, addressing the rapidly growing AIDS crisis, and providing much-needed education and transit reform. On the foreign side, President Kennedy did not have many unique proposals, aside from calling for a massive nuclear freeze and beginning sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime with the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act. Many historians and observers have no doubt that John is proud of his youngest brother, and allows the Kennedy dynasty to go on, leading America to a bright, shining future."
Haig88.1.d:0 "Truly, the United States under President Alexander Haig has been transformed into a New World Order. Major accomplishments of the Haig Administration include the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Ryan White CARE Act, providing crucial protections to people with disabilities and providing support to victims of AIDS. With the support of Canada and Mexico, President Haig signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, praised by foreign relations scholars as a hallmark of cross-continental trade cooperation. On the military front, Haig, a former Army general and Supreme Commander of NATO, signed the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Control Act, as well as an infamous executive order deploying the US National Guard in the War on Drugs. Haig famously also vetoed the 1990 Civil Rights Act, replacing it with one the next year, as well as the Flag Protection Act, which prescribed penalties for destroying the American flag. Truly, while shepherding the United States into the close of the 20th century, President Haig accomplished very much while in office."

 #AIDS Events
 AIDSGOP.1.d:0 "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), caused by infection from the HIV virus has seen a steady rise in cases since the late 70’s in the nation. This disease, which is primarily spread via sexual contact, is incurable and is usually fatal. Recently we’ve also noticed cases of innocent Americans being infected via blood transfusions. The CDC has recommended the issuing of lifetime bans on donating blood to drug users and same-sex individuals , due to their high risk of contracting the virus. Additionally, many states have begun to pass laws criminalizing the intentional transmission of HIV in the nation, in an attempt to slow the rise of HIV. The religious and political organization, Moral Majority, has condemned AIDS as a divine punishment sent by God, to punish America for its growing acceptance of homosexuality and abortion in the country."
 AIDSGOP.5.d:0 "The Federal Government announced today that new funding for research on AIDS and the HIV virus will be prohibited, with the President stating that additional funding will not be necessary to combat the epidemic. This has been condemned by many doctors throughout the nation, and by some figures on the left, claiming that the Government is putting dollars over American lives by crippling HIV research efforts. Jerry Falwell, leader of the Moral Majority, has claimed that there is no point in funding research into AIDS, because it is a disease caused exclusively by gay men, and it was God’s ordained punishment for their sins."
 AIDSGOP.10.d:0 "Today, the Surgeon General of the United States has released a report on the AIDS crisis in America. He has recommended a widespread campaign of AIDS education, as prevalent myths have spread like wildfire, such as AIDS being transmitted via mosquitos , or just by simple skin to skin contact. He has also pushed for male contraceptive use to become more widespread. These sex education and contraceptive proposals have received some pushback from social conservatives, who prefer a more limited, abstinence only sex education. Jerry Falwell, leader of the Moral Majority, has come out against the Surgeon General’s Report, claiming that additional funding and tolerance with people infected with AIDS will only waste taxpayer dollars. Falwell has instead recommended bringing God back in school and the fabric of American life, which he claims "would limit the spread of homosexuality, the vector for the AIDS disease"." 
 AIDSLib.1.d:0 "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), caused by infection from the HIV virus has seen a steady rise in cases since the late 70’s in the nation. The CDC is requesting for additional funding to continue research on the disease, in hopes of finding either a cure or providing more adequate treatment. The Department of Education has also begun to partner with the HHS and CDC to create and fund education programs on AIDS, in hope to reduce transmissions and dispel harmful myths about the disease. This has received strong opposition from Social Conservatives in the nation, who claim the Government is misappropriating taxpayer money on a disease that is caused by homosexual deviants. Jerry Falwell, of the Moral Majority, has pledged to help primary against any Republican politicians who support the Government's measures on AIDS."

 VRA_Enforcement80s.1.d:0 "Today Attorney General [GetCurrentAG] has announced new measures to be taken by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These measures are a response to court decisions that weakened certain aspects of the bill, and claims of lingering racist resistance in pockets across the nation. The DOJ will begin establishing new centers for reporting voter discrimination, especially in minority neighborhoods, which have been lacking in such areas. The DOJ has also instructed the FBI to begin investigations of local and state governments that have previously sought to keep voting centers out of red-lined minority neighborhoods , which they claim hurts the amount of minority voters. The Attorney General has also announced new funding for early voting campaigns in these areas, to reduce the stress on current facilities. Finally, the FBI has been given clearance to aggressively target any far-right groups that would try to impede voting by any minority groups. Some conservative politicians have criticized Attorney General  [GetCurrentAG] announcement, levying accusations that these policies are only being created to gain voters for the President in the next election. The NAACP however, has praised the President and Attorney General, calling it a great day for the nation and African-Americans."
 Executive_Order_12333.1.d:0 "Today President [USA.GetLeader] signed Executive Order 12333, requiring all federal agencies to cooperate with the CIA requests for information. The order also expands the range of permitted information being collected, which includes lawful intelligence information, counterintelligence, and intelligence relating to narcotics trafficking and terrorism, all without needing warrants. Additionally, the order restates the current ban on intelligence agencies planning or conducting assassinations. Concerns have been raised by civil liberty groups, who claim that this executive order dramatically expands the power of current intelligence agencies, without any additional ways to provide oversight over these new powers."
 Executive_Order_12333.2.d:0 "A surprise ruling came from the Court of Appeals in Washington,DC , ruling that Executive Order 12333 violates a presumed constitutional right to privacy, due to the wording relating to collected intelligence being too vague and a lack of suitable oversight. The lawsuit was spearheaded by the ACLU, who expressed grave concerns on the wide range of information being sent to the Central Intelligence Agency, citing past abuses committed by the Agency. The administration has strongly criticized the Court, claiming that Executive Order 12333 was only intended to increase organization and coherence within the Intelligence Community, not to broadly expand its powers. Many hawks in Congress also issued a statement condemning the ruling, stating that the Court is putting national security as risk. It is not yet known if President [USA.GetLeader]’s Administration will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court."

 RWCA_Veto.1.d:0 "Today President [USA.GetLeader] shocked the nation and announced that he will be vetoing the Ryan White Care Act passed by Congress. Named after Ryan White, a child who was infected with HIV via a blood transfusion, the act would’ve been the largest federal funding program for HIV/AIDS. The President has defended his decision , claiming that the funds are unnecessary for fighting a virus that only affects specific parts of the population. The President also reiterated his goals to not waste taxpayer money on projects that do not give back to all American citizens. His statement has faced staunch criticism from both Congress and HIV/AIDS support groups, with many individuals condemning the President as homophobic and will be directly responsible for more AIDS deaths to come. Some figures on the far-right, such as Moral Majority leader Jerry Falwell, praised President [USA.GetLeader]’s veto, stating that AIDS is a homosexual disease only, and God-fearing Americans do not have to worry about being infected. Congress, which passed the bill with overwhelming support, is expected to attempt to override the President’s veto in the coming weeks."
 RWCA_Veto.2.d:0 "We are planning to expect a large challenge from Congress in the coming days, with both many of our own members and the opposition planning to vote against us. Our best bet to stop the override attempt is to apply pressure on our more religious members, and attempt to use the threat of being primaried against them. We could also call in old favors from some more moderate members, and offer them concessions in other key areas of legislation. Finally, we could try to pressure our party leaders in each chamber, with the offer of a possible administration position after their term ends, or extra support during their re-election cycles. While the vote will definitely be close, we believe it is possible to snuff out their attempt."
 RWCA_Veto.3.d:0 "Today Congress has overridden President [USA.GetLeader]‘s veto of the Ryan White Care Act. The President faced a large number of his own party members going voting against him, with just a few more extreme members coming to his side. Many AIDS support groups across the nation have celebrated the news, condemning the President’s veto attempt, and praising Congress for coming together to help the nation. When asked for comment, the White House Press Secretary stated that the President plans to move on, focusing on other pieces of legislation currently being written. Some far-right groups attacked the decision to override the veto, claiming the bill is a waste of money on a limited issue."
 RWCA_Veto.4.d:0 "Congress failed to override President [USA.GetLeader]’s veto today, coming up just short of a 66 supermajority in the Senate. The President thanked the members who voted against the veto, calling them great heroes and their act of courage shall not be forgotten. Reportedly the White House had to make a string of concessions to many Senators to change their vote, including possibly offering top positions in the administration. The nation has generally responded negatively to the news, with 7 out of 10 Americans polled supporting the bill. Elton John, a noted LGBTQ singer, announced his creation of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, in an attempt to provide support that was lost from the veto. Multiple AIDS groups declared today a dark day for the country, stating that America has turned its back on those who needed it the most, and the President should be ashamed of himself."

 War_on_Drugs80s.1.d:0 "Despite the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, and various other anti-drug campaigns, The United States has still seen a rise in drug abuse and deaths throughout the nation. Crack, a much cheaper form of smokable cocaine, has become widespread throughout African American communities. Also new, still legal drugs, such as MDMA, have grown in popularity in many underground music scenes, causing great harm to our nation. Today President [USA.GetLeader]has announced new policies to ramp up the War on Drugs. These measures include a significant reform of our current drug laws, establishing 3-strike felony laws for drug possession, providing the ability for families who lost their loved ones to drug abuse to sue the drug dealers behind the sale for damages, and a comprehensive drug education program to be created and implemented into our schools. Congress has generally been receptive to the policy, although some more liberal democrats and libertarian members have expressed opposition , calling the War on Drugs a waste of money, and a violation of the American people’s personal rights."
 War_on_Drugs80s.2.d:0 "Today President [USA.GetLeader] has announced a new campaign for the War on Drugs, however one led more by education and science, rather than additional, heavy handed law and order measures. These include reexamining much of the Schedule I/II drugs currently listed, with a few medical experts stating that drugs such as marijuana should be treated more like alcohol than like heroin and other "hard substances". The President has also announced a focus on greatly expanding drug education in schools, claiming that teaching the new generation the truth about these substances will be the key to ending the War on Drugs. The President has received pushback from many conservative politicians, and law enforcement groups, who claim marijuana is still a very harmful drug, as it acts like a gateway into many other substances. There are also reports that the President may veto any bill passed by Congress that increases sentencing penalties for simple drug possession."
 War_on_Drugs80s.10.d:0 "Today Secretary of Defense [GetCurrentSecDef] has announced a large increase in coordination with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in an attempt to crack down on the growing drug crisis in America. In addition, the Secretary also announced that President [USA.GetLeader] has approved the use of the National Guard to help crack down on illegal drug farms and labs found throughout the country. The National Guard will specifically execute raids on cartels and drug networks in the nation using DEA intelligence, provide additional training to local and state law enforcement in conducting successful drug raids, and also run an educational program in regions it will operate. These educational programs will include hosting a public awareness campaign, and heading into local schools to provide additional lectures. This new program has generated significant pushback from the ACLU, and many liberal congressmen, who claim that the militarization of the police has a chilling effect on the country, and will potentially dampen the rights of many of those charged with drug crimes. Meanwhile law enforcement has been very receptive to the additional manpower, calling it the weight needed to tip the scales of the War on Drugs."

 USJapanTrade.1.d:0 "Since the late 70’s, Japan has been taking advantage of our generous trade policies by flooding the American market with new automobiles, televisions, and diverse electronics, all of which have come at a cost to our homegrown industry. While we still wish to maintain Japan as an allied partner in the region, due to their geography providing us a direct foothold into the Far East, we must demand that Japan agrees to limit their exports to our shores, and halt the buying of many prominent American companies. Thankfully, the majority of Congress has also been concerned about the Japanese trade issue, and we should have bipartisan support for any measures we may need to take to resolve this imbalance."
 USJapanTrade.2.d:0 "The American Ambassador has recently "requested" a Renegotiation of our current trade deals with the United States, claiming that our exports have caused great harm to their domestic industry. While currently the United States stands as our biggest ally in the world, these economic tensions have stirred up strong anti-Japanese sentiments in the United States, even leading to the murder of a Chinese-American (mistaken for a Japanese-American) by a pair of laid off automotive workers in Detroit, Michigan. These tensions have led many in our government being receptive to the idea of renegotiations, or finding a middle ground deal for both sides. However, a few hardline officials believe that we should not give up our current economic advantage, as we could use it as a way to put Japanese interests first, and not become so beholden to the United States."
 USJapanTrade.3.d:0 "We’ve just received word from Japan that they’ve agreed to all our major demands. Already plans for future Toshiba and Nissan shipments have been shelved, the Japanese government has begun selling back much of the American debt bought from the US Treasury, and the Japanese’ Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry has also given us a "gentleman’s agreement" that no more major American icons will be bought by any Japanese citizen. Congress has been receptive to the news, with even the hardliners agreeing to drop any sanctions bills being drafted."
 USJapanTrade.4.d:0 "Japan has not accepted all our demands put forth by our Ambassador. While Japan is openly willing to adopt a voluntary export limitation on motor vehicles, they still are contesting our requests to limit the creation of additional factories in the United States. Accepting this compromise offer would help restore the import/export imbalance back to a more reasonable number, but our companies would have to fight against Japanese owned goods made on our soil. Hardliners in Congress and our administration have been pushing for a rejection of Japan’s compromise, and the issuing of sanctions on Japanese goods. However, the more free-traded minded members of our Government warn this could backfire on our economy, hurting our domestic industries even more and raising the cost of automobiles across the country. Also some advisors in the State Department have raised the possibility of Japan instead seeking closer relations with other powers, such as Europe or possibly China, if we push too hard on the matter"
 USJapanTrade.5.d:0 "Japan has completely rejected our offer of renegotiation on our trade deals. Further attempts to diplomatically convince Japan to come to the bargaining table appear to also have fallen on deaf ears. Congress , especially the Republican members, have been calling for large and widespread sanctions of various parts of the Japanese economy, claiming it to be an issue of National Security. Our administration is generally in concurrence with Congress, as some sanctions appear to be the only way to bring Japan back to the table. However, some advisor’s suggest we drop the issue, having pointed out the risk of harming wider Japanese-American relations, possibly losing Japan as our foremost ally in the Pacific, and pushing them closer to economic rivals such as Europe or China."
 USJapanTrade.6.d:0 "The ambassador from the United States has informed us that we would face widespread sanctions on various parts of our economy if we don’t agree to their current demands. Our government has been divided on how we should respond to the threat. Many of our more moderate advisors have pushed for us to accept the American Government’s demands, as losing access to American markets would negatively impact much of our companies revenues , and we could also possibly lose the United States, our largest ally, leaving us more vulnerable to Chinese or Soviet influences. A significant part of our Government however, also is claiming that our industry is strong enough to withstand the loss of some American markets, and presented possible projections for expanding in Europe / Asia to replace the lost revenue."
 USJapanTrade.7.d:0 "We’ve received a phone call today from the Japanese Ambassador informing us that Japan has again rejected coming down to the negotiating table in the face of economic sanctions. Already Congress has begun drafting up resolutions demanding the President immediately take action to limit Japanese imports, and the NYSE has begun dropping rapidly due to reports of imminent sanctions. Backing down would leave us at where we started, and humiliating us intentionally, while issuing the sanctions would hopefully resolve the trade imbalance and restore our domestic industry back to strength, but at the cost of harming Japanese-American relations, possibly causing long term harm to our position in the Pacific, and potentially raising the cost of many household goods in the United States."
 USJapanTrade.8.d:0 "The President of the United States unveiled a list of new trade sanctions targeting the Republic of Japan today, after weeks of attempting to negotiate the trade imbalance between the two nations collapsed. These sanctions are mainly targeted at the Japanese automotive and electronic industry, under the justification that Japan has unfairly taken advantage of the American economy and national security. Japan has responded by criticizing the American sanctions, claiming that they break the close co-operation that Japan and the United States have developed together, and that America has gone back on its previous principles of upholding free trade between nations.Congress has generally expressed support for the President’s actions, with a resolution being passed hours before calling on President [USA.GetLeader] to limit Japanese exports. The New York Stock Exchange is expected to drop dramatically over this announcement , as Japanese American trade relations are facing a steady decline."
 USJapanTrade.9.d:0 "The President of the United States has unveiled new sanctions on the Republic of Japan today, after Japan refused to agree to any American demands to adjust the current trade issues between the two nations. President [USA.GetLeader] has justified these sanctions, which are primarily against the largest pieces of Japanese Industry, such as automobiles and electronics, as a measure to defend American national and economic security against an unfair and hostile trading power. Japan has condemned the sanctions, decrying America’s request for renegotiations unjust, and describing the sanctions as economic bullying. Congress has strongly backed the President, earlier passing a resolution calling for less imports from Japan. The public has also responded positively, with most Americans viewing Japan as being unfair in rejecting America’s requests. The New York Stock Exchange is expected to drop dramatically over this announcement , as Japanese American trade relations reach a new low."

 USMILDEM.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] today has come out against our current defense budget, calling it bloated and mismanaged, and requesting the GAO run a full, in depth audit of the current budget. This development has led to strong criticism from both Republican and moderate Democrat politicians, who argue that with rising Cold War tensions that additional funding will be needed to let our military keep up with the Soviets. The President has stood firm on his pledge, and has signaled he would consider vetoing the next National Defense Authorization Act if the military does not cut down on wasteful spending or lower it’s current budget. Many European nations , which were hoping to have new ballistic missiles shipped over to counteract the recent Soviet deployments, now express worry about losing their nuclear shield in Europe."

 USAMIL80s.1.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] today called for a major increase in the current defense budget, arguing that the United States has fallen behind the Soviet Union in many key factors, such as naval superiority , ballistic missile production and research, and advances in anti-air and early warning radar technology. The President also stated that the Soviet’s ongoing involvement in the backing and funding of many communist rebel groups threatens American sovereignty, which can only be protected by providing a bulwark of ordnance and training to our allies defending freedom. The funding would specifically go to recommissioning the old Iowa-class Battleships to provide extra firepower, expediting the production of new carriers and submarines, rapidly deploying the Pershing II to regain nuclear dominance in Europe, and issuing large research grants for our Air Force to combat Soviet anti-air and radar developments. Many liberal congressmen have come out against the new funding, declaring it only brings us closer to WWIII and waste’s taxpayer dollars than can go to domestic affairs. Anti-Nuclear activist group Greenpeace has also announced a new round of protests against the new nuclear funding measures, calling the President a madman who wants to see the world burn."
 USAMIL80s.2.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] announced today his proposal for expanding the current Armed Forces budget, arguing that the US is falling behind the Soviets in certain key areas of defense, such as naval procurement and ballistic missile deployments. The President has stated the new funding will allow America restore it’s aging Iowa-class Battleships to combat readiness, and provide new upgrades for our current carrier and submarine forces. The President also stated his concern about losing tactical nuclear superiority in Europe without the deployment of new IRBMS. While some liberal members of Congress came out issuing statements that the Military Budget is wasteful and needs to be shrunk, Congress generally was receptive to the new funding requests. Anti-War groups criticized the announcement, saying any new funding robs American’s of money that could go to education or fighting poverty."
 USAMIL80s.3.d:0 "President Wilson today has issued a request to Congress to restore a variety of defense funds cut from the last administration. Much of the funding he requested be restored is planned to be used by the CIA and other departments to provide training, humanitarian supplies, and armaments to American backed rebel groups and governments. Wilson declares that these funds are essential for securing American superiority abroad, as they will lose many Third World nations to communism without it. Many liberals and moderates in Congress have come out against the policy, criticizing Wilson for ignoring our own aging military , and throwing away billions of dollars without much oversight of what it will be spent on. Proponents of Containment and Rollback however, have come out in support of Wilson, arguing that the Cold War will be won or lost due to these small, regional conflicts."

 CUBUSA80s.1.d:0 "Today President [USA.GetLeader] announced the signing of the Cuban Rapprochement Act, which would end the current embargo on Cuba, and begin the path of restoring relations to the island. While Cuba and the United States have been on opposing sides for most of the Cold War, tensions between the nations have cooled considerably since the Crisis of 62’ decades ago. The President said it is time to move past old conflicts, pointing out the U.N opposition to the embargo, and Cuba’s role in the Non-Aligned Movement as proof it is not a simple Soviet puppet. The announcement has been met with great hostility from warhawks in Congress, claiming the embargo kept Cuba weak and isolated, and that the President is blatantly hurting America’s interests throughout the world. A particularly small group of extreme hawks in the nation has called for the resignation or impeachment of President [USA.GetLeader] for betraying the United States."
 CUBUSA80s.2.d:0 "We’ve received a call today from American Secretary of State [GetCurrentSecState], informing us of the country’s plans to end the embargo and restore relations with our Republic. Many of our advisors consider this a golden opportunity to expand the economy and gain greater recognition on the world stage. However, some hardliners see this as opening up our economy to crony capitalism, and America is only making this offer in an attempt to destabilize Cuba through economic trickery. Normalized relations could also lead to another emmigration crisis for our nation, worsening the brain drain. However, food supplies and medicine that will now enter the country will greatly help us, and possibly free us from such dependence on the Soviet Union."
 Carey88.1.d:0 "Today, President Carey, in the presence of major union leaders from the United Auto Workers (UAW), the Communication Workers of America (CWA), and United Steel Workers (USW) announced a new set of policy initiatives under the banner of the "Made in America Initiative”. Among this initiative's proposals is increasing tariffs on foreign steel, cars, and various other imports along with tax credits for domestic manufacturing corporations. While being praised by elected officials and union members throughout the Rust Belt and Northeast, many farm advocacy groups and elected officials from areas affected by the Farm Crisis have expressed concern over how these changes will impact the American farmer."
 Kerry_NAFTA.2.d:0 "In a ceremony in the White House’s East Room, President Kerry signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into law while being accompanied by several former Presidents and supporting Congressional leaders. Free trade activists and many economists have praised this move despite past uncertainty over how President Kerry would handle the negotiations, given his hesitancy over dealing with NAFTA during the 1988 campaign. On the other side of the aisle, union leaders have come out swinging against President Kerry, describing the decision as a betrayal of the voters who put him in the White House.\n\nIn other reactions, outspoken billionaire and philanthropist Ross Perot has condemned the agreement as a loss of American sovereignty, and rumors have begun that he is laying the groundwork for a Presidential campaign in 1992."
 Kerry_NAFTA.3.d:0 "During the 1988 campaign, President Kerry generally avoided the debate over the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In a televised address, the President, surrounded by opponents of the proposed trade deal such as Labor Secretary Luis Gutierrez, House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, and representatives from several major labor leaders, announced that America was withdrawing from NAFTA negotiations. President Kerry proceeded to give his reasoning for abandoning the proposed trade deal, most notably including a lack of protections for American workers along with concerns over environmental protections in Mexico. Public reaction to the decision has varied heavily, union workers in the Midwest and textile workers in the South have largely reacted positively to the announcement, while free trade activists and farm interest groups have condemned the move as limiting the potential of the American economy. In other reactions, noted billionaire and philanthropist Ross Perot praised the President’s address."
 Cronkite88.1.d:0 "Going into the 1980 election, things did not look bright for the social liberal wings of either party. Between the rise of the Moral Majority, backlash to the Equal Rights Amendment, and the cultural excesses of the late 1960s, many would not have expected the social progress that has occurred over the last decade. The surprising election of John Anderson in 1980 and later on the election of his Vice President in 1988 to the Presidency has led to various forms of social progress. Between advances on gay rights, investments into education, environmental protections, and a renewed push for the Equal Rights Amendment, the 1980s has, to the surprise of many political analysts, seen a remarkable resurgence of social liberalism in the United States.\n\nGoing even farther, President Cronkite in the 1988 campaign promised to further defend liberal values by advancing protections for civil liberties, immigration reform, and advancing other social causes. During his first term, not only has this been achieved but President Cronkite in a controversial move declared an end to the War on Drugs due to its impacts on racial minorities and urban America. While Anderson and Cronkite’s supporters have praised these moves along with various civil rights organizations, many Evangelical political advocacy groups have condemned these measures as eroding the moral fabric of America."
 Cronkite88.2.d:0 "In a national address, President Cronkite announced an end to the War on Drugs. The President cited the impacts of the heavy-handed approach to drug abuse as outweighing the potential benefits of getting drugs off the street. Instead, the President is advocating for increased funding for rehabilitation and education services, along with promoting programs for renewed economic activity in economically depressed areas ripe for drug abuse. This announcement has had a polarizing effect on the American public,while civil rights groups in particular have praised the move for being a step forward towards better policing, law enforcement groups have denounced the statement as an attack on law enforcement and Middle America. Evangelical groups on the other hand have mostly denounced the move as another example of President Cronkite eroding the moral fabric of America."
 CHAFFEE.1.d:0 "The last decade has been a tumultuous one for the gay community. Between the onset of the AIDS epidemic and renewed attacks from conservatives with the rise of the Moral Majority movement earlier in the decade. Given this backdrop John Chafee, a noted liberal Republican supportive of gay rights, was to say the least a surprising nominee for the Grand Old Party going into the 1988 elections. In a news conference earlier today, President Chaffee signed an executive order allowing openly gay service members to enlist and serve in the various branches of the armed forces. Gay rights organizations, along with civil liberties advocates cheered the executive order. On the other side of the aisle, evangelical leaders along with conservative Republican officials widely condemned the decision as a betrayal of core conservative values and a further blow to morality in America."
 Anderson.1.d:0 "In a televised press conference at Yosemite National Park, President John Anderson delivered an address outlining his new program for Environmental Conservation.The program includes several executive orders expanding the powers of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and enforcing the Endangered Species Act. While conservation and environmental groups cheered the announcement, many conservative and business groups criticized the announcement arguing that the expanding of the EPA’s power would further empower Washington bureaucrats to hamper business and harm economic growth. Other critics argue that this is another example of President Anderson abandoning his prior conservative rhetoric over the years and further outline the need for a true conservative option for the 1984 elections."
 Anderson.2.d:0 "During the 1980 presidential campaign, then-candidate John Anderson repeatedly made calls for expanding National Parks and ensuring safeguards were in place to preserve the natural beauty for future generations. With Anderson’s ascendancy to the Presidency, one of his first major executive orders has been to establish new safeguards on National Parks to prevent resource exploitation along with establishing various new National Parks throughout the nation. Many in the public cheered the decision on both sides of the aisle along with conservation and environmental groups praising the President’s actions, that said business interests, in particular from the mining sector along with the United Mine Workers expressed concerns over the expansion of parks in areas with probable deposits of valuable resources, especially in West Virginia and the American Southwest."
 AndersonGOP.1.d:0 "Going into the 1980 Republican primaries, the ascendancy of the conservative faction within the party seemed inevitable. However, to the shock of many, noted liberal Republican John Anderson took the nomination in a major political upset. With Anderson’s victory in the general election, the position of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Bill Brock, a noted Reagan ally’s days as head of the Grand Old Party, are surely numbered. With the impending purge of the RNC and the threat of Anderson backed primary challenges to several Congressman and Senators, many are questioning if a new realignment is inevitable or if a conservative third party will emerge. Conservative Republican leaders such as Paul Laxalt, Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond have signaled their intentions to back primary challenges to liberal Republican Senators in the 1982 midterms."
 AgnewMcCarthy.1.d:0 "Spiro Agnew is no stranger of controversy throughout his political career going back to his days in Annapolis. At a campaign event in Wisconsin earlier today President Agnew decried what he claims are "left-wing saboteurs” in the government that are in collusion with liberal elites. President Agnew followed this by announcing his intention to expand observation and background checks of federal workers as well as reviewing funding allotments to certain educational institutions. Critics in the media, liberal advocacy groups, civil rights groups, as well as the Jewish Anti-Defamation League attacked the speech as an assault on individual liberties, minorities and a return to the McCarthyism of the 1950s. On the other hand, several Republican governors have speculated that this move could be a good opportunity to redirect education funding to law enforcement or enact new tax cuts."
 Brooke84.2.d:0 "The years after the assassination of President Gerald Ford have been tumultuous for American politics. With President Nelson Rockefeller seeking to reshape the Republican Party in his image, the nascent Evangelical political movement championed by the Moral Majority became more radicalized and one of the main beneficiaries of this has been the John Birch Society. Led by Congressman Larry McDonald, the organization has massively benefited the Moral Majority’s newfound alienation from the Republican Party. This trend only escalated with the selection of Edward Brooke as Vice President along with his successful Presidential campaign in 1984. In a blistering address today, President Brooke condemned the group as hatemongers and linked their supporters to a recent spate of hate crimes throughout the Deep South. Congressman McDonald fired back stating that President Brooke was deflecting from the problems facing America and furthering America’s moral decline."
 Brooke88.1.d:0 "Looking at the political history of the United States since the Great Depression, not many would have expected the resurgence of liberalism in the Grand Old Party. Yet in a bizarre twist of fate, the assassination of President Gerald Ford has led to this occurrence. With Vice President Nelson Rockefeller ascending to the Presidency and his successful nomination in 1976 against former Governor Ronald Reagan, the conservative activist wing of the party began to decline in influence. The various social liberal reforms championed by Rockefeller and Brooke has led to southern voters and evangelicals leaving the Grand Old Party in droves. This reorientation of American politics has also led to a resurgence in strength of the Southern Democrats to levels not seen since before the 1960s. That said, tensions in both parties are ripe and calls for a third party are rising daily. Regardless, President Brooke, the first African-American President, will surely go down in history for playing such a major role in reorienting American politics."
 BrownConvention.1.d:0 "In a contentious press conference in Washington today, President Jerry Brown laid out his proposal to hold a Second Constitutional Convention by having the required number of states ratify the call for one and send delegates to said hypothetical convention. President Brown justified this drastic call by arguing that the traditional amendment process is too restrictive and that the drastic changes that have occurred in the post-war era necessitate drastic changes to the Constitution. In particular, President Brown is calling for amendments fundamentally altering the tax structure of the nations, term limits and a renewed push for the Equal Rights Amendment. Conservatives have widely panned the announcement as a power grab but have vowed that if a convention is held they will send delegates to fight for conservative amendments including an amendment to reverse Roe v. Wade."
 BrownCC.1.d:0 "To the shock of many, President Brown’s call for a Second Constitutional Convention was a success. In a contentious vote late yesterday, Pennsylvania became the 34th state to request an Article V convention which in turn met the required number of states to call such a convention. With the required number of states now requesting a convention, it is only a matter of time until the convention begins. While President Brown was the one to initiate the process, many conservatives have argued to participate in the convention to try to block any progressive amendments and argue for conservative amendments such as an end to affirmative action and reversing Roe v. Wade. Only time will tell how drastically this alters the Constitution."
 BrownCC.100.d:0 "As President Brown’s term comes to a conclusion, it has become apparent that the push for a Constitutional Convention will come up short. While the President championed the measure as a necessity to further clean up and reform Washington, opponents have widely criticized the proposal as a blatant power grab that would set a dangerous precedent for the future. In addition, many Democrats expressed skepticism that even if the convention was held, that Brown could have corralled the members to a productive meeting or control the body to ensure no radical measures were added to the Constitution. That said, President Brown has expressed his disappointment but vows to continue the fight for government reform in the years to come after his tenure in the White House."
 Brown84.1.d:0 "As President Brown’s second term nears an end, he decided to hold a news conference discussing his legacy. During the press conference, Brown argued that he believes his greatest legacy will be his fight for civil rights and government reform. Throughout his Presidency, Jerry Brown has fought for defending and expanding civil rights, environmental protections, and major investments in education and science. Business interests and social conservative advocacy groups have repeatedly attacked President Brown’s social and economic policies for being overly heavy-handed towards business and destroying the moral fabric of America. With that said, Brown’s supporters see the President as having defended their rights and having fought for social progress and economic growth but not at the cost of the American worker. Time will tell how the history books remember the Brown Administration, but surely it will not simply be a footnote in a future textbook."
 Dukakis88.0.d:0 "During the 1988 presidential campaign, now-President Michael Dukakis heavily ran on the theme of beginning his success as Governor of Massachusetts, termed the "Massachusetts Miracle” nationwide. As President in his first term, so far Dukakis has fought to reverse Reaganomics, fight for environmental protections and relieve farmers suffering throughout the ongoing farm crisis. More controversially, the President’s trade policies have signaled a sharp contrast to his predecessors from both sides of the aisle. Dukakis has ended negotiations and plans for a North American Free Trade Agreement, along with trying to pressure Japan to revise their trade balance with the United States. Overall, the administration has vigorously defended the rights of unions and American workers, that said fights still remain for a potential second term, most notably the growing debate over the President’s healthcare initiatives."
 Kennedy80.0.d:0 "During the 1980 campaign trail, now President Edward "Ted” Kennedy repeatedly issued a call to declare a six month freeze on inflation. While details on the plan were criticized as spotty at best, the President in an address today outlined how this would be achieved. In short, Kennedy will seek to institute temporary wage and price controls to combat inflation for the next several months. The reaction to this has been mixed at best. Conservatives lambasted the plan as a band-aid solution that will only kick the proverbial can down the road. Others attacked the plan as recycling failed Nixonian policies from the infamous "Nixon Shock” from the prior decade. With that said, the general public per polling seems to be cautiously supportive of the plan. Time will tell how this gamble will pay off for the Kennedy Administration."
 Kennedy80.1.d:0 "During the 1980 campaign, then-Senator Edward "Ted” Kennedy vigorously argued that the federal government needed to enforce the Humphrey-Hawkins Act to guarantee a job to all able bodied citizens over the age of 17 with the goal of reducing unemployment to below 4% by 1983. While the Act was signed in prior years, President Kennedy and other liberal leaders have argued for years that the government was not properly enforcing the law. During a campaign rally in Philadelphia today, President Kennedy announced he would be directing federal agencies to increase economic planning and job offerings in partnership with willing private-sector companies to boost employment levels. While the President’s supporters cheered the decision as keeping a campaign promise, conservative opponents condemned the move as a further step towards socialism."
 Kennedy80.2.d:0 "During his past campaigns, President Kennedy repeatedly invoked the legacy of his siblings along with echoing a simpler period of American politics prior to the assassination of his brothers. That said, President Edward "Ted” Kennedy has come out of his elder brother’s shadow during his two terms. Between fighting to preserve the strength of American unions and Keynesian economic policies, to his fights for gay rights, women’s rights and environmental rights, the President chartered a strongly liberal administration. While this antagonized conservative voters, especially those evangelical voters, liberals and other supporters of the President argue that the President is the greatest champion of American Liberalism since President Roosevelt. Time will tell how President Kennedy’s policies will impact America, but no one can deny his impact on the politics of the decade."
 Wallace80.0.d:0 "For decades, George Wallace has been one of the most controversial American politicians of the 20th century. With that said, his ascension to the Presidency with the election of 1976 came to a shock to the nation and world. Despite his past history as a race-baiting firebrand, President Wallace has forged a left-populist coalition of Evangelicals, union members and rural voters through a combination of fighting for trade renegotiations with other nations to boost American manufacturing, fighting for disability rights, expanding the social safety net, revitalizing the space program and fighting to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nWhile popular with Southerners and union members, his detractors have criticized Wallace as vastly expanding the federal deficit. Additionally, the President has been actively condemned by various feminist organizations over his calls to outlaw abortion. Regardless, the presidency of George Wallace will go down as a transformative one for American politics."
 Wallace80.1.d:0 "In a campaign rally in North Carolina, President Wallace announced the need to escalate the War on Drugs. In his address, he remarked on the increasing levels of inner-city crime and homeless rates tied to the drug epidemic. President Wallace then decried atheism and moral decay as the core driver of the drug epidemic. To counter this growing problem, President Wallace is advocating for more stringent mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, more funding for law enforcement, along with overturning Miranda v. Arizona. Furthermore, the President also called for bringing back religion into the classroom of public schools by overturning Engel v. Vitale as well. The reaction to the address has been mixed; Wallace supporters, especially evangelical voters strongly support the proposals, especially overturning Engel v. Vitale; on the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has strongly condemned the proposals for violating freedom of speech and undermining civil liberties."
 Wallace80.2.d:0 "In a press statement released yesterday evening, the Wallace Administration announced they intend to expand the Office of Economic Planning. The new responsibilities of the organization will be to help properly plan American economic initiatives and draw up policy proposals to be considered by the Federal Reserve, Congress and White House. Additionally, the move would also further empower the OEP to aid in planning communities and housing across the nation. Supporters of the administration praised the move as a needed move towards a more regulated economic system. Opponents, especially free market advocates, blasted the move as a further infringement on the market as another step towards a planned socialist economy."
 Wallace80.3.d:0 "The landmark decision Roe v. Wade has since its inception been a polarizing political issue. With the growing power of Evangelical voters and the rise in social conservative issue groups such as the Moral Majority, the debate has become all the more visceral. In an address today, President George Wallace repeated his denunciation of the ruling and went further in attacking the Supreme Court for handing down the decision in the first place. The President then proceeded to call for a constitutional amendment overturning the decision which would shortly be introduced into the House of Representatives by White House allies. The reaction to the speech has been polarizing to say the least. Evangelical and Catholic leaders praised the announcement, thanking President Wallace for his desire to fight for the life of the unborn, while others attacked the President over his rhetoric against the court as well as for trying to reverse years of progress for women's rights."
 Wallace80.4.d:0 "In a fiery press conference today, President George Wallace announced a new executive order that will effectively ban the importation of foreign cars. The President defended the measure as a needed protection for the domestic auto manufacturing industry as well as defending American auto workers. Reception to the measure has been mixed to say the least. On one hand, the United Auto Workers (UAW) put out a statement praising President Wallace’s defense of the American worker. Elsewhere, free market advocates and conservative advocates blasted the measure as blatant cronyism. Consumer advocates further attacked American automobile manufacturers as being behind the curve in terms of innovation and that this measure would only hurt innovation in the industry. The measure has also been condemned by several foreign governments, including Japan and West Germany, both countries with competitive car manufacturing industries.."
 Wallace80.5.d:0 "In a televised address yesterday evening, President Wallace outlined his new policy for American trade. This follows the President’s controversial move to ban imports of foreign cars. The proposed new trade policy has the stated goal of putting the American worker first. In effect, the policy will lead to an increase in tariffs as well as avoiding signing onto future free trade agreements. The reaction to the proposal has been as polarizing as anything else the President has done over his years of political experience, with union leadership widely praising the measure along with other supporters of protectionism. On the other hand, many economists have criticized the proposal and argue it will lead to long-term increases in consumer prices, while other traditional opponents of the Wallace Administration argue that this is just another example of the crony capitalism that has been occurring for years under President Wallace."
 Wilson80.1.d:0 "The ascension of George McGovern to the Presidency was highly controversial, not only to the general public but within the Democratic Party itself. With McGovern’s commitment to limited intervention throughout the world was cheered by doves and isolationists, many Democrats condemned McGovern’s foreign policy as being weak towards the Soviets and being against fundamental American values. Congressman Charlie Wilson’s victory in the 1980 Democratic primary over Vice President Sargent Shriver clearly demonstrated that McGovern failed to sway the bulk of the party into being isolationists. In an interview today, President Wilson strongly reiterated his condemnations of McGovernism and stated that his administration will re-evaluate America’s foreign policy and covert operations along with requesting additional funds for the CIA in the upcoming budget negotiations."
 Wilson88.1.d:0 "In his initial Presidential bid, Congressman Charlie Wilson championed the hawkish wing of the Democratic Party in a reaction to the isolationism of President McGovern. Early in his first term, President Wilson outlined why his administration was seeking to expand the power of the security agencies along with abandoning the foreign policy aspects of McGovernism. That said, the Wilson Doctrine is not simply a regurgitation of old ideas from rollback advocates. The doctrine not only calls for supporting anti-communst guerilla movements to advance the cause of freedom but to also provide economic and political assistance after liberation to promote a more democratic liberal world order. This approach has come under attack from McGovernites who condemn President Wilson as an imperialist along with fiscal conservatives who argue that nation building in the third world is too much of a budgetary expense for the current economy."
 Wilson_JAP.6.d:0 "In a joint press conference today, President Wilson and Japanese Prime Minister [JAP.GetLeader] announced a new bilateral security and economic agreement. The agreement includes revisions to the trade relations between the two countries, seeking to reduce the trade deficit between them while also including terms for Japan to begin re-militarization allowing the United States to reduce its troop presence in the nation. The reaction to this announcement has been extremely polarizing. The US State Department and Ambassador to Japan put out a joint statement praising the move as a needed step for regional peacekeeping while the Chinese, Soviets and North Koreans denounced the move as imperialist and a danger to regional security."
 Wilson_JAP.7.d:0 "In a surprising declaration earlier today, the Japanese government announced their intention to seek changes to the constitution and commence re-militarization. In particular, the proposal calls for a major expansion in Japanese naval and air assets, including multiple aircraft carriers. This comes after President Wilson publicly called on the Japanese government to make trade concessions and make a commitment to re-militarization so that America could shift its forces to other theaters. The reaction to this announcement has been mixed to say the least. The US State Department and Ambassador to Japan put out a joint statement praising the move as a needed step for regional peacekeeping while the Chinese, Soviets and North Koreans denounced the move as imperialist and a danger to regional security."
 Clinton88.0.d:0 "During the 1984 Presidential Campaign, then-Governor Bill Clinton advocated for the creation of an Economic Security Council. This council would incorporate leading economists, union representatives and business executives to coordinate potential economic policies for the nation by building a consensus between these three often-opposing groups. While at a campaign rally in Little Rock, Arkansas, today, President Clinton formally announced the establishment of this council. While the group will not have the authority to actually dictate policy, the President has stated he plans to use these groups in guiding his economic policies and for budget negotiations with Congress in the coming years. Supporters of Clinton argue that this will help reduce conflict in the economy and help economic growth. Progressive critics of the President have called the proposal as selling out to major corporations, while conservative critics have condemned the council as a tool for crony capitalism."
 Clinton88.1.d:0 "After his narrow re-election in 1988, not many would have expected the ascension of Bill Clinton to the Presidency, let alone his victory over Ronald Reagan in 1984. Yet not only was President Clinton able to retake the White House for Democrats in 1984, but was able to reverse the excess of Reaganomics while fighting for investments into education and infrastructure. As the end of President Clinton’s Presidency is in sight, it is clear that President Clinton was able to revitalize Southern and Appalachian Democrats. With that said, the President’s push for financial deregulation, welfare reform, and support of NAFTA has been a source of criticism for liberals and progressive activists in the Democratic Party. At the same time, conservatives have attacked the administration for its social liberalism. Regardless, time will tell how President Clinton’s administration lived up to its campaign promise of "Putting People First.”"
 Connally84.1.d:0 "In a bizarre press conference today, President John Connally announced he would be directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to reopen the John F. Kennedy assassination case. President Connally has long been a critic of the official report and notably was present at the assassination due to being the governor of Texas at the time. The response to the announcement has been widely ridiculed by the media and liberals as well as being condemned as a blatant political ploy by the Kennedy family. On the other hand, conspiracy theorists and certain conservative activists have praised the announcement as a necessary step to restore faith in the federal government. Regardless, whatever new report is released by the FBI will likely only be more fodder for debates on who was actually responsible for the Kennedy assassination."
 BushAlt84.1.d:0 "In a press release statement yesterday evening, the Bush Administration announced that they would be immediately lifting oil price controls that have been in effect since the height of the Second Oil Crisis. The statement noted the increase in domestic oil production, increased foreign supply and stabilization in foreign markets has led to this moment. That said, prices for gasoline and oil domestically have increased this morning, possibly eroding consumer confidence in the economy. Critics argue that the move was made too early in an attempt to please the President’s corporate backers while supporters of President Bush argue that this was a needed move towards normalizing the economy."
 Connally84.9.d:0 "In a press release statement yesterday evening, the Connally Administration announced that they would be immediately lifting oil price controls that have been in effect since the height of the second oil crisis. The statement noted the increase in domestic oil production, increased foreign supply and stabilization in foreign markets has led to this moment. That said, prices for gasoline and oil domestically have spiked this morning eroding consumer confidence in the economy. Critics argue that the move was made too early in an attempt to please the President’s corporate backers while supporters of President Connally argue that this was a needed move towards normalizing the economy."
 Connally84.10.d:0 "At the start of President John Connally’s term, America was in dire straits. With "stagflation” plaguing the economy and the Second Oil Crisis further twisting the knife in the American economy, it was critical that the new administration would be able to restore confidence in the American economy. Through sound fiscal policies and pairing increased domestic oil production with price supports, the Connally Administration has managed to restore confidence in the American economy. In terms of politics however, the former Democratic Governor of Texas has been a polarizing figure. By playing up his former Southern Democratic roots, Connally has managed to attract a large number of defections to the Republican Party. However with this Southern focus, Northern moderates and liberals within the Grand Old Party have been heavily alienated, especially in Connally’s second term. The veto of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act proved to be the final nail for many liberal Republicans with several, including Senators John Chaffee (RI) and Arlen Specter (PA) defecting to the Democratic Caucus. Regardless, President Connally will surely be remembered for realigning American politics for decades to come."
 Trump88.0.d:0 "In a blistering press conference at the White House today, President Donald Trump questioned America’s commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The President denounced Alliance members not paying their fair share of military expenses and the disparity leading to America having to foot the bill at the cost of its economic potential. The statement immediately sparked a political firestorm with mainstream Congressional members of both parties denouncing the remarks as a danger to American national security. On the other hand, both far left and far right political advocates have praised the announcement as a step towards world peace or putting America first respectively. Notably, Congressman Ron Paul, a quixotic libertarian-tinted Republican Congressman from Texas; and Bernie Sanders, an independent quasi-socialist Congressman from Vermont, both praised the announcement as a rare example of bipartisanship."
 Baker88.1.d:0 "Throughout his political career, Howard Baker has been a strong advocate for a balanced budget. That said, his approach to it has created plenty of enemies on both sides of the aisle. Unlike other conservatives, President Baker advocated that a balanced budget could not be solely on the backs of the poor by slashing the social safety net. The President’s repeated bills to raise taxes while also changing welfare policy has earned the ire of both liberals and supply-side economic advocates.With that said, after nearly two terms in office, the President has managed to slash the federal budget deficit through various compromises with both sides of the aisle. That said, a balanced budget amendment has still not been enacted and President Baker has signaled he will continue to champion the proposal in the coming years after his Presidency is over."
 Baker88.2.d:0 "Throughout his political career, Howard Baker has been a strong advocate for a balanced budget. That said, his approach to it has created plenty of enemies on both sides of the aisle. Unlike other conservatives, President Baker advocated that a balanced budget could not be solely on the backs of the poor by slashing the social safety net. The President’s repeated bills to raise taxes while also changing welfare policy has earned the ire of both liberals and supply-side economic advocates. With that said, the compromises reached in his first term to reduce the deficit have angered the activist base of the Republican Party. In response to this, conservative firebrand Pat Buchanan has signaled that he will challenge President Baker in the upcoming 1992 Republican Primary for President."
 Baker88.3.d:0 "Throughout his political career, Howard Baker has been a strong advocate for a balanced budget. That said, his approach to it has created plenty of enemies on both sides of the aisle. Unlike other conservatives, President Baker advocated that a balanced budget could not be solely on the backs of the poor by slashing the social safety net. The President’s repeated bills to raise taxes while also changing welfare policy has earned the ire of both liberals and supply-side economic advocates. With that said, after nearly two terms in office, the President has managed to slash the federal budget deficit through various compromises with both sides of the aisle. With the 1988 election on the horizon, time will tell if the Republican Party can hold on to the Presidency, and even if so if will they continue to hold on to Baker’s position on a balanced budget. That said, this all assumes the Republican nominee can defeat the Democratic nominee in the coming election."
 Mondale80.1.d:0 "The nomination of Walter Mondale in 1980 represented a decisive rejection of McGovernism in the Democratic Party. In a press conference today, President Mondale outlined the future steps planned to reverse McGovernism, primarily focusing on undoing the various privatizations conducted under the McGovern administration. Along with this, Mondale professed a desire to return to the New Deal Liberalism of past Democratic administrations. The reaction to this among the anti-McGovernites in the Democratic Party has been largely positive, with supporters calling the move a return to traditional Democratic values. On the other hand, McGovernites blasted the announcement as a betrayal of the legacy of President McGovern and a step backwards on the road to economic prosperity. On the other side of the aisle, conservatives denounced the measure as a return to big government."
 Mondale80.2.d:0 "During the 1980 campaign, then-Senator Mondale vigorously argued that the government needed to enforce the Humphrey-Hawkins Act to guarantee a job to all able-bodied citizens over the age of 17 with the goal of reducing unemployment to below 4% by 1983. While the Act was signed in prior years, President Mondale and other liberal critics of McGovernism have argued for years that the prior administration was not properly enforcing the law. During a campaign rally in Milwaukee today, President Mondale announced he would be directing federal agencies to increase economic planning and job offerings in partnership with willing private-sector companies to boost employment levels. While the President’s supporters cheered the decision as keeping a campaign promise, conservative opponents condemned the move as a further step towards socialism. Additionally, McGovernites condemned the move as eroding the legacy of President McGovern and recycling failed economic policies from the past."
 Mondale84.10.d:0 "For 16 years now the Democrats have held the White House, a feat not seen since the Great Depression and World War II. However, the differences between the two administrations could not be more stark. McGovern’s victory in 1972 represented a rejection not only of Nixonian politics, but also to the older liberalism embodied by Mondale’s political mentor Hubert Humphrey. With McGovernism firmly rejected by the Democratic Party, and President Mondale ushering in a revitalized New Deal Coalition as well as pushing through various laws expanding the American welfare state, surely President Mondale has managed to avenge his mentor’s losses in the 1968 and 1972 elections. Regardless, Walter Mondale will be remembered as the President who was able to reunite the New Deal Coalition and defend liberalism against a resurgent conservative movement buoyed by the Moral Majority."
 MONDALE88.100.d:0 "As the Mondale Administration comes to a close, it is a time to reflect on the past 16 years of Democratic rule. Coming out of the tumultuous 1960s and 1970s, President Mondale was able to continue to guide the economy and build on the reforms of President Carter. After the 1968 and 1972 elections, many political analysts predicted that the days of the New Deal Coalition were coming to an end. However, President Mondale has firmly laid that theory to rest. Under his administration, various socially liberal and economically Keynesian policies have been enacted or improved from their prior incarnations. Between the civil rights expansions, the death penalty moratorium, expanding healthcare access, restoring Great Society programs along with fighting for environmental protections, President Mondale has clearly demonstrated that the American public still was willing to listen to progressive solutions to modern problems. Detractors of President Mondale have repeatedly criticized the President’s handling of social and economic affairs, in particular his expansion of the social safety net, and reduction in military expenses."
 Mondale88.1.d:0 "Coming out of the 1980 election, not many would have predicted Vice President Walter Mondale to have such a comeback in 1984. The media in the early 1980s were all but writing the obituary of the New Deal Coalition, to the shock of the political media, then-candidate Mondale ran clearly as a New Deal liberal. Mondale’s victory was attributed to being able to regain ground in the South along with sweeping the Industrial Midwest. President Mondale’s administration has controversially pushed to reverse Reaganomics. Overall, between the civil rights expansions, the death penalty moratorium, expanding healthcare access, restoring Great Society programs along with fighting for environmental protections, he has clearly demonstrated that the American public still was willing to listen to progressive solutions to modern problems. Detractors of President Mondale have repeatedly criticized the President’s handling of social and economic affairs, in particular his expansion of the social safety net and reduction in military expenses."
 Dupont.0.d:0 "During the 1988 Republican Primaries, President Pete DuPont came under fire from conservatives and Reagan loyalists for his repeated calls for ensuring accountability over the Iran-Contra Affair. Building off this and other criticisms of the Reagan Administration’s foreign policy choices, the President decided to hold an interview on "60 Minutes” to explain his views on foreign policy as well as outline the DuPoint Doctrine on foreign policy and covert actions. In the interview the President outlined that supporting freedom fighters and anti-communist forces in foreign nations is an important priority for the nation but must have proper safeguards and Congressional approval. Furthermore, the President stressed that the United States needed to make sure the causes being backed were appropriate and matching with the country’s founding ideologies to support a democratic state post-liberation. The Heritage Foundation and other Reaganite allies and think tanks put out a statement blasting the President for his criticisms of the Contras and the former President."
 Dupont.1.d:0 "The Department of Justice late Friday evening put out a statement noting that Lawrence Welsh was appointed by President DuPoint as Special Investigator into the Iran-Contra Affair. While on the campaign trail, then-candidate DuPont stressed the need for further investigations into the scandal, with many Republicans during the primary and general elections criticizing DuPont’s fixation on the issue. The reaction to the announcement from conservatives in the Republican Party has been largely negative, with many Republicans condemning the President as a traitor to the party. On the other side of the aisles, prominent Democrats praised the President for wanting to ensure justice was served."
 Dupont.3.d:0 "In a shocking revelation today, Special Investigator Lawrence Welsh announced that the federal government would be pressing charges against former President Ronald Reagan and former Vice President George HW Bush under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) over their roles in the Iran-Contra Affair. The announcement has set off a political firestorm. Conservative leaders have called for protests and several Republican Congressman, including Newt Gingrich have called for the President’s impeachment. Conservatives within the party have also begun a draft Jack Kemp campaign for the 1992 Republican primaries over this move, along with DuPont’s other legislation going against conservative wishes. On the other side of the aisle, Democrats praised the Justice Department’s swift action and noted their desire for a quick trial."
 Dupont.4.d:0 "Late on a quiet Friday evening, the Justice Department issued a statement noting that former President Reagan and Vice President Bush would not be indicted for their roles in the Iran-Contra Affair. While the investigation into the scandal continues, including indictments of several former administration officials, it would appear for now that Reagan and Bush will not be charged with any crimes. Conservative Republicans praised the decision while also attacking President Pete DuPont over the process of the investigation. With that said, even without the former President being indicted, the scandal will almost certainly taint Reagan’s legacy and likely doom any future presidential bid by former Vice President Bush."
 Dupont.5.d:0 "After several weeks at trial, both the defense and prosecution rested their case in the blockbuster cases against the former President and Vice President. Within 24 hours, the jury returned a guilty verdict. While sentencing will not occur for several more days, minimum sentencing in regards to racketeering charges will surely have a lengthy sentence. The reaction to the trial has been visceral and polarizing. Conservative organizations in support of Reagan, including the Moral Majority and Club for Growth have put out calls for protests and are openly calling for a primary challenge to President DuPont in 1992. Liberal Republican leaders such as John Chaffee and Arlen Specter praised the court for coming to a swift decision and praised President DuPont’s actions. Democrats have largely, if pressed to comment, praised the jury for its decisive response to the trial."
 UDALL88.1.d:0 "The counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s, along with the civil rights movement, sparked a conservative backlash; further amplified over several major court rulings, especially the landmark case Roe v. Wade. With this backlash, the future of American liberalism looked bleak. However, President Mo Udall has prevailed in pushing back the conservative current and championed several progressive causes, in particular; pushing for healthcare reform, federalizing welfare, and advocating for environmental and health protections. That said, President Udall’s administration is not without Democratic detractors; labor unions often raised issues with the President’s free trade policies, especially his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement; while conservative opponents argued that increased social spending was dragging down the American economy and handouts to the undeserving. That said, President Udall is leaving the Presidency with solid approval ratings and with the economic recovery and reforms occurring under his administration should have a profound political legacy."
 Bush84.1.d:0 "The assassination of President Ronald Reagan in 1981 was a landmark moment in America, capping off nearly two decades of unrest and political assassinations. Coming into office on the heels of such tragedy and unrest, President George Bush chartered a moderate course emphasizing what he titled "Compassionate Conservatism.” As President, Bush aimed to seek a bipartisan consensus with a largely hostile Congress to deal with issues such as abortion funding, responding to the AIDS crisis, and seeking a middle ground on tax reform. Beyond this, the President’s moderate stances, calm demeanor and foreign policy skills presented a strong, caring leader for the nation in a trying time. Regardless of how President Bush’s domestic policies are remembered, he will be remembered as a unifying figure in the 1980s that guided America out of one of its darker periods."
 Bush84.2.d:0 "At a speech in New York City to investors today, President George Bush outlined his problems with the supply side economics promoted by conservatives and Reaganites within the Grand Old Party. Previously during the 1980 Republican primary, then-candidate Bush described supply side economics as "Voodoo Economics.” Bush doubled down on this rhetoric today, arguing that this form of economic theory would only ramp up the federal deficit while redistributing income to top earners. The President instead argued that the goal should be to seek a balance between conservative economics and previous Keynesian economic policies, along with a focus to reduce the federal deficit with compromises from both sides of the aisle. The reaction to the speech from the general public has been broadly positive; and while the outer flanks of both parties raised issues with the policy; most Americans seem to be content with a moderate economic policy focusing on getting America past the current "stagflation” crisis."
 Bush88.0.d:0 "In light of the recent increases in violent crimes, especially murders and police shootings, President George Bush announced today that he would be issuing an executive order to restrict the import of semi-automatic firearms. Public safety advocates and police unions have largely praised the decision as a common sense initiative to reduce the gun violence plaguing American cities. Gun rights advocates, especially the National Rifle Association (NRA) have largely condemned the measure as an illegal overstretch of federal authority and a gross violation of the Second Amendment, and have promised a legal challenge to the decision. Experts do not believe that the legal challenge has any merit with the current composition of the Supreme Court."
 Bush88.1.d:0 "By the time George Bush ascended to the Presidency he had developed a reputation for being knowledgeable on foreign relations based on his work in prior administrations. With the Soviet Bloc in crisis by the late 1980s, a more inexperienced President easily could have blundered the nation into a major international crisis. President Bush has managed to strengthen the diplomatic ties between America and its allies along with seeking stable relations with the Soviet Union. Regardless of what comes next, President Bush will be remembered as a strong leader on the world stage, and perhaps the instigator of a so-called "New World Order” if the Russian bloc does indeed crumble..."
 Bush88.2.d:0 "Prior to ascending to the Presidency in 1984, George Bush served in prior administrations in foreign policy and covert operation related roles. Of particular note is Bush’s prior service as head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). With the shifting tides of the Cold War in the late 1980s and amid increasing global instability, President Bush has been able to navigate America through these tumultuous times without engaging in brinkmanship or sparking an international crisis. With the Russian bloc potentially on the precipice, perhaps President Bush will go down as the progenitor of a "New World Order”. Regardless, President Bush will go down as one of the best post-war statesmen of America. This said, the President’s domestic legacy looks less sure with the contentious primary between Bush’s Vice President Dan Quayle and conservative firebrand Pat Buchanan."
 Simon88.1.d:0 "In a press conference today, President Paul Simon called on Congress and the states to pass and ratify a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Many would be quick to note that this is perhaps an odd call for a noted liberal Democratic President, given that most balanced budget activists tend to be conservatives. That said, Simon ran as a fairly unorthodox liberal in the 1988 primaries, with a focus on social liberalism and ensuring a sound currency to mitigate inflationary pressure on consumer prices. The reaction to the proposal has been mixed; supporters of the President argue that this is a needed measure to avoid future inflationary problems as seen in the 1960s and 1970s. Conservative supporters of a balanced budget amendment largely support this version of the amendment but vow to fight with the President over how to actually achieve a balanced budget. More traditional economic liberals condemned the measure as a move that goes against economic theory along with being a gateway to slashing welfare spending."
 McGovern84.1.d:0 "America’s foreign wars and involvement in proxy wars against the Soviet Union were a major focus of McGovern’s campaigns, both in 1972 and 1984. To the shock of nearly everyone, President McGovern managed to win the 1984 election after such a massive landslide twelve years prior. At a campaign rally in Des Moines today, McGovern outlined his new approach to foreign policy his administration would follow. The crux of the speech was arguing that America should seek peaceful relations with the Soviet Union while offering political and economic support to democratic allies, while also arguing that American operations in Latin America should be primarily in support of the self-determination of the native people, not in the defense of oligarchs and mega-corporations. The speech has been polarizing; supporters of McGovern praised the new policy as a major step forward for a peaceful world, many Democrats attacked McGovern as an isolationist, while Republicans argued that the President was selling out our allies across the globe."
 McGovern84.2.d:0 "During a campaign rally in Newark, New Jersey, President McGovern announced he would be winding down the War on Drugs. The President argued that the current policies were doing more harm than good; while noting that drug abuse is a major issue, it is one that should be dealt with medically and with rehabilitation of users, not lengthy jail sentences. Furthermore, McGovern argued that the funding being spent on the program could be reallocated to deal with more pressing issues such as inner-city poverty. Supporters of the President cheered the move and argue that this is in keeping with both his 1972 and 1984 campaign promises. Other Democrats expressed concern over the measure and how it may impact crime rates. Conservatives on the other hand lambasted the President, arguing that this is just another example of the radical policies of the administration and how the President wished to destroy the moral fabric of America."
 McGovern88.2.d:0 "Looking back at the results of the 1972 election, almost no one, perhaps not even George McGovern himself could have expected this. Not only was McGovern able to surprisingly win the 1984 Democratic nomination but also to the shock of the entire political world, able to defeat the sitting President. Following that, McGovern was able to govern as a solid liberal. Much to the ire of the religious right and hawks in both parties, the President moved to wind down the War on Drugs, reevaluate America’s foreign commitments and fight for native self determination. These same critics also argued that President McGovern regularly governed as an out-of-touch leftist, that said McGovern managed to decisively win re-election in 1988. While Democratic detractors argued that the President moved away from traditional Democratic values, the strength of the American economy under the President has largely quieted any public opposition from the left. Overall, President McGovern managed to reshape American politics and not only that managed to vindicate his prior political defeats both nationally and within the Democratic Party."
 Kissinger88.0.d:0 "In light of the recent increases in violent crimes, especially murders, police shootings and hate crimes, President Henry Kissinger announced today that he would be issuing an executive order to restrict the import of semi-automatic firearms. Public safety advocates and police unions have largely praised the decision as a common sense initiative to reduce the gun violence plaguing American cities. Gun rights advocates and supporters of former President McDonald, especially the National Rifle Association (NRA) have largely condemned the measure as an illegal  overstretch of federal authority and a gross violation of the Second Amendment and have promised a legal challenge to the decision. Experts do not believe that the legal challenge has any merit with the current composition of the Supreme Court. That said, former President McDonald urged his supporters to protest and write to their elected officials to overturn the decision, further fanning the rumors of a potential comeback campaign in 1992 for the former President."
 Kissinger88.1.d:0 "In a televised address today, President Henry Kissinger announced that the United States would be ending its boycott of the United Nations. Stating that the previous administration doing so heavily weakened American influence abroad and that participating at the United Nations once more would be a key step towards rehabilitating America’s international reputation. Supporters of the President, along with internationalists in both parties praised the decision by Kissinger. On the other hand, former President McDonald lambasted the decision as another sellout of American sovereignty to globalist interests. The former President then stated at a campaign rally in Tampa, Florida, that Americans "needed to take the country back from the globalist interests once again.” The Anti-Defamation League condemned former President McDonald over his remarks in light of several anti-Semitic hate crimes occurring in Florida and New York in the coming hours after both speeches."
 Kissinger88.5.d:0 "In a Friday evening press release, the Justice Department confirmed that the Western Goals Foundation was under federal investigation in relation to their actions during the McDonald Administration. The Western Goals Foundation was rumored for years to be a sort of parallel covert operation network for allies of the former President. Given the rumors of a comeback bid by the former President one would likely wonder how the McDonald camp will react to this probe. With that said, the former President put out a statement stating that the probe was a political witch hunt against himself and his allies with the goal of discrediting his movement and planned 1992 campaign."
 Landgrebe80.1.d:0 "In a combative press conference with the media today, President Earl Landgrebe announced his intention to seek to rehabilitate the reputation of infamous anti-communist Senator Joseph McCarthy. Loyalists of President Landgrebe and former President Spiro Agnew largely voiced support for the decision to extol McCarthy as an American hero who vigorously tried to defend America from internal communist subversion. Liberal Republicans and Democrats on the other hand, lambasted the decision as a political sideshow to distract from the economic problems currently plaguing the nation, along with condemning the glorification of the violation of civil liberties and libel. Regardless, this is just another sign of the conservative backlash in America resulting in the Agnew and Landgrebe presidencies."
 Landgrebe88.1.d:0 "The election of 1968, per many political pundits, signaled the demise of the New Deal Coalition. Twenty years later, and this was clearly a correct prediction. Even with Watergate taking down President Nixon, President Agnew and then Landgrebe were able to keep the new Republican coalition together and roundly defeat the Democrats and liberal Republicans within their own party in the elections, following the scandal and economic slump of the late 1970s. While naturally, this streak of victories will eventually end, one can only reminiscence that once upon a time Agnew was demeaned as one of the least fit men to be President during the 1968 campaign, and that the media noted then-Congressman Landgrebe as the "most idiotic Congressman” during Watergate. These two men managed, despite the media and liberal opposition to reshape America over the years since the fall of President Nixon, for better or worse time will tell."
 Lucey88.0.d:0 "A common theme of the Anderson-Lucey Administration was the need for establishing an economic consensus between the various disparate parts of the American economy. As a part of this economic ideology, President Patrick Lucey earlier today announced the establishment of the Economic Security Council. The council will incorporate leading economists, union representatives and business executives, to coordinate potential economic policies for the nation by building a consensus between these three often-opposing groups. The President noted during the press conference that while the group will not have the authority to actually dictate policy, the White House plans to use these groups in guiding their economic policies and for budget negotiations with Congress in the coming years. Supporters of the President argue that this will help reduce conflict in the economy and help economic growth. Progressive critics of the President have called the proposal as selling out to major corporations and another perversion of the Democratic Party’s core values, while conservative critics have condemned the council as a tool for crony capitalism."
 Lucey88.1.d:0 "Looking back at the 1980 Democratic primary, this was surely not the expected outcome. Patrick Lucey, the former Governor of Wisconsin, Ambassador to Mexico, and campaign deputy chairman for the 1980 Kennedy campaign, surprisingly endorsed the Anderson campaign and joined as its running mate. Condemning President Carter in his speech accepting the role, Lucey argued that it was not him who abandoned the Democratic Party but President Carter who abandoned the party. Initially, many in his own home state of Wisconsin decried him as a fallen star of the state party. That said, with the victory of the Anderson campaigns in 1980 and 1984 and Lucey’s own victory in 1988, Lucey ended up being the one to reforge the Democratic Party once more into a bastion of social and economic liberalism. Regardless, what many expected to be a decade built upon a conservative backlash to the 1960s and 1970s ended up being a renewed era of liberalism in America."
 Gore88.1.d:0 "After years of economic uncertainty and shaky financial policy from Republican governance, Al Gore, former Senator from Tennessee, was able to emerge victorious out of the 1988 Presidential Election. As President, Gore has aimed to increase educational standards, revitalize rural America, fight for environmental standards, and safeguard welfare programs, especially social security. Perhaps just as importantly, the Gore Administration has heavily invested in computer and networking technology, helping kickstart adoption of the Internet and giving America a critical leg up in technological development. The overall Presidency of Al Gore in his first term so far has largely been non-controversial with critics mainly attacking his expansion of federal bureaucracy in regards to his environmental policies. That said, as President Gore considers re-election, problems persist, in particular dealing with the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement that threatens to tear the Democratic Party apart."
 Haig88.1.d:0 "The ascendance of Alexander Haig, former White House Chief of Staff and NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, to the Presidency was a decisive moment for American foreign policy and military affairs. Under Haig, the post-Vietnam era of American military decline has come to a conclusive end. Since his inauguration, President Haig has sought to expand the role of military education in schools, vastly expand funding for the military industrial complex and empower the security services. The aggressive posture of the administration has aided American-backed proxies in various conflicts around the globe. With the Soviet Bloc currently imperiled, the coming years could see the rise of America as the sole global power, thus creating a so-called "New World Order” under Alexander Haig."
 Hart88.0.d:0 "The ascendancy of Gary Hart to the Presidency represented a turning point in the Democratic Party, representing a generational turnover in leadership. The so-called "Atari Democrats” including President Hart, Senator Al Gore (D-TN) and Senator Tim Wirth (D-CO) have emerged as the new leaders of the party, focusing on technological and market solutions to social and economic problems instead of government mandates and direct intervention in the market. The focus on increased market liberalism along with foreign trade deals paid dividends in terms of electoral success for the Hart Administration but has caused divisions within the Democratic Party. Traditional Democratic supporting groups, such as labor unions, have routinely criticized the President’s handling of international trade, and more liberal Senators have criticized the administration for not pushing to vastly expand the social safety net."
 Jackson84.1.d:0 "During a press conference earlier today, President Jesse Jackson proposed slashing the Department of Defense’s budget. The President argued that the current levels of military spending are damaging to the economy and the funds could be more usefully spent on social welfare spending programs. President Jackson campaigned heavily on the idea of redirecting military spending to social spending, especially when it comes to reviewing certain military programs, notably the Strategic Defense Initiative. Doves and liberals cheered the announcement as a needed step towards world peace and correcting the budget deficit, while warhawks and conservatives attacked President Jackson’s proposal as unrealistic and damaging to America’s national security."
 Jackson84.2.d:0 "In a fiery campaign rally in Harlem, New York, earlier today, President Jackson announced he would be not only ending the War on Drugs but starting his own War on Bankers. Per President Jackson, the War on Drugs has not only been a massive failure, but in reality just a new attack on African-Americans and other minorities, while Wall Street continues to feed off the American worker and take advantage of the American farmer during the ongoing farm crisis. President Jackson also signaled that he would be directing the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation to increase audits and investigations of major banking institutions. The response to the speech by conservatives has been nothing short of apoplectic with conservative commentators denouncing President Jackson as a Marxist."
 Jackson88.0.d:0 "The Presidency of Jesse Jackson may have been one of the most transformative Presidencies in not only modern American history, but post-war global history. On the domestic front, President Jackson sought to improve the lives of Americans by fighting for progressive economic reforms and ending the disastrous War on Drugs and combating Wall Street corruption. Perhaps more notably in terms of foreign policy, the Jackson Administration sought to reach a comprehensive peace treaty with the Soviet Union. While problems remain, a possible end to the Cold War is in sight, along with the potential for longer-reaching nuclear arms control agreements. Opponents of the President still maintain that Jackson is a communist and actively destroying America from the inside, given his slashing of the military, foreign policy and economic budgets."
 Jackson88.1.d:0 "The last decade has been a tumultuous one for the gay community, between the onset of the AIDS epidemic and renewed attacks from conservatives with the rise of the Moral Majority movement earlier in the decade. Given this backdrop, Jesse Jackson, a progressive African-American pastor not only winning the Democratic primary, but general election, was a massive political upset. In a news conference earlier today President Jackson signed an executive order allowing openly gay service members to enlist and serve in the various branches of the armed forces. Gay rights organizations along with civil liberties advocates cheered the executive order. On the other side of the aisle, evangelical leaders along with conservative Republican officials widely condemned the decision as a betrayal of core conservative values and a further blow to morality in America."
 Jackson88.3.d:0 "In a televised interview with "60 Minutes,” President Jesse Jackson announced his change in belief on abortion. The President announced that he would no longer aim to restrict abortion access or overturn Roe v. Wade. He noted after discussions with various activists that he could not in good faith try to overturn abortion rights, while still having moral issues with the issue, the President noted it should not be up to the government to be involved in the medical lives of its citizens. The reaction to the speech has been mixed; liberals applauded the President’s shift in beliefs, while various pro-life advocates and organizations blasted the President’s betrayal of the pro-life cause."
 Muskie80.1.d:0 "Going into the 1980 Democratic National Convention, one would not be mistaken to believe that the chances for a Democratic victory in the fall would be slim. With a bitter primary between the President and Senator Edward Kennedy, along with the upswell in conservative support, tidings for liberals in the Democratic Party looked bleak. With a deadlocked convention, Senator Muskie became the consensus choice for the nomination. Riding off his opponent’s radical conservatism, Muskie was able to win the 1980 election. With credit for the economic recovery, President Muskie was able to achieve a decisive re-election in 1984 along with pushing through various progressive policies aiming to reduce the increasing income inequality in America."
 Muskie80.2.d:0 "Coming after the rejection of liberalism in 1968, many political pundits hailed the election as the demise of the New Deal Coalition. That said, the election of Edmund Muskie eight years later proved this pronouncement to be premature. While the crisis of the late 1970s nearly led to the defeat of the President in 1980, the economic recovery of the early 1980s led to major gains for the Democrats and the ability for Muskie to push through various progressive measures in his second term with a focus on educational and environmental policy. While opponents of the administration criticize the expansion of the federal bureaucracy, especially the Environmental Protection Agency, the President’s approval rating remains reasonably high and will surely go down as one of the greatest environmentalist leaders of the time."
 Rumfeld84.1.d:0 "During an address to Congress recently, President Donald Rumsfeld announced his intention to void all arms control agreements that the United States currently are party to.. The President argued that the arms control agreements signed by prior administrations are overly restrictive in terms of both the nuclear program and traditional arms, and are hampering America’s national security along with limiting what weapons could be provided to American proxies abroad. The international reaction to the announcement has been nearly unanimously negative with condemnations from the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, China and the United Nations General Assembly. Domestically speaking, supporters of the President praised the decision as the bold decisive leadership America needs. Outside of the President’s core base, the announcement has garnered wide condemnation for being immoral, unethical and harming America’s foreign relations."
 Rumfeld88.1.d:0 "In an interview with a conservative media outlet over the weekend, President Rumsfeld outlined his foreign policy doctrine for his new administration. The President immediately noted that the State Department would be abandoning attempts at detente and containment and would instead focus on rollback of communism on various fronts; signaling renewed covert and overt support for various anti-communist causes across the globe. The President noted in particular the need to invest more in armed African movements against communist regimes, especially Jonas Savimbi’s National Union for the Total Independence (UNITA) in Angola, currently embroiled in a civil war against the communist government backed by Cuba. Opponents of the President condemned the brinkmanship of the President and intentions to violate various laws prohibiting support for certain foreign insurgencies."
 Rumfeld88.6.d:0 "Recent reports from figures within the major American Anti-Apartheid movement, including the Free South Africa Movement (FSAM) and the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) indicate massive internal issues and cohesion problems. A slightly larger law enforcement presence around FSAM and ACOA meetings, particularly those of high-level members, has been noted by some members and officials within the organizations; and some maintenance personnel have noticed slight damage to window frames, computer systems, and telephones within the national offices. It is unclear what is causing this rift and problems, but something very suspicious is happening in the Anti-Apartheid movement."
 Rumfeld88.7.d:0 "In breaking news today, a sudden leak by a Department of Justice staffer to the Attorney General revealed a government campaign of espionage on anti-Apartheid organizations in the United States. Signed off by President Rumsfeld and spearheaded by the FBI and Department of Justice, a leaked memo discussed "the threat of feminist, liberal, communist, socialist, and anarchist forces in our country” and specifying surveillance and monitoring of organizations such as the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and Free South Africa Movement (FSAM). Published initially in the New York Times, other major newspapers domestically and internationally have caught this story, amid dead silence from the White House or the Department of Justice."
 Shriver80.1.d:0 "As the first term of the Shriver Administration draws down as election season picks up, the legacy of McGovernism is still a major topic within the electorate. While President Shriver has largely kept most aspects of McGovern’s foreign policy, he has shown clear concessions to other wings of the Democratic Party to try to heal the divisions caused by his predecessor. While none of the major privatizations done by McGovern have been reverted, Shriver has fought to expand healthcare access, increased education funding and aimed to run a more protectionist administration. This all said, the core of McGovernism is still intact within the party, assuming Shriver can win re-election, perhaps McGovernism will firmly become the new core ideology of the party."
 Shriver84.1.d:0 "Over the course of Shriver’s presidency, the Administration has gone to great lengths to mend relations within the Democratic Party without overly violating any of the key aspects of McGovernism. Given the contentious 1980 primary and further divisions after its conclusion, the need to balance traditional economic liberalism and McGovernism became all the more critical. That said, President Shriver has largely managed to accomplish this with various compromises and offerings to other Democratic factions in terms of domestic politics. In terms of the opposition, Republicans have largely condemned the administration as isolationist and actively reducing American security by continuing McGovern’s policies in terms of the military and foreign policy. That said, after 16 years McGovernism is clearly the new dominant ideology in the Democratic Party for the years to come."
 Stevenson84.1.d:0 "The election of George Wallace in 1976 clearly represented a shift in the party towards catering to evangelical voters, especially as President Wallace lobbied for support from organizations such as the Moral Majority. With that said, with Vice President Stevenson, a committed social liberal winning the 1984 election, tensions within the party; between the traditional Democratic base and evangelical Wallace supporters; will likely become a major issue within the Democratic Party in the coming years, especially with the former President still actively lobbying for his right to life amendment to the Constitution. Any drastic move on social issues for either front will likely risk severely dividing the Democratic Party for the foreseeable future."
 Stevenson84.3.d:0 "In a major address in Detroit, Michigan, earlier today, President Stevenson disavowed former President Wallace’s continued advocacy for a right to life amendment overturning Roe v. Wade. The move, while not entirely surprising given Stevenson’s pro-choice leanings being known from his career prior to becoming Wallace’s Vice President, does still represent a decisive move back towards social liberalism in the Democratic Party after the presidency of George Wallace. Wallace supporters within the party have condemned Stevenson for the move and argue that he is betraying the legacy of President Wallace and voters that put Stevenson into office. Feminist advocacy groups praised the move and also noted they hoped that President Stevenson would revive the fight for the Equal Rights Amendment."
 Stevenson84.4.d:0 "In another departure from former President Wallace, President Stevenson called for Congress to resurrect the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). While the ERA authorization expired under the Wallace Administration, Stevenson is calling on the courts to rule on the legality of the authorization window and should the courts not rule against the window period for Congress, to once more start the process for ratification. Social conservatives, especially Wallace supporters, condemned the move as another betrayal of the former President. Feminist, civil rights and other liberal activists praised the move as a needed measure to protect minorities. Regardless, the fight over the ERA will continue for years to come."
 Stevenson84.5.d:0 "In a press conference today, President Stevenson announced he would be lifting former President Wallace’s policy banning foreign car imports. President Stevenson argued that the policy at this point was harming American consumers by increasing the costs of cars along with harming America’s trade relations. The response to the announcement from consumers has largely been positive. That said, American car manufacturers and the United Auto Workers (UAW) condemned the move. Many supporters of former President Wallace also condemned the move as President Stevenson going against the legacy of the precious president. The response demonstrates once more the rising divisions in the Democratic Party between the liberal and moderate factions, largely supportive of President Stevenson, while the conservative faction composed of supporters of former President Wallace have become increasingly alienated."
 Stevenson88.0.d:0 "During the 1984 presidential campaign, then-Vice President Stevenson advocated for the creation of an Economic Security Council. This council would incorporate leading economists, union representatives and business executives to coordinate potential economic policies for the nation by building a consensus between these three often opposing groups. While at a campaign rally in Chicago, Illinois, today, President Stevenson formally announced the establishment of this council. While the group will not have the authority to actually dictate policy, the President has stated he plans to use these groups in guiding his economic policies and for budget negotiations with Congress in the coming years. Supporters of the President argue that this will help reduce conflict in the economy and help economic growth. Progressive critics of the President have called the proposal as selling out to major corporations while conservative critics have condemned the council as a tool for crony capitalism."
 Stevenson88.1.d:0 "During a press conference earlier today, President Stevenson announced his plan to establish a Trans-Pacific Free Trade Agreement. The proposed trade agreement would include several American allies such as Japan, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. Economists and free trade proponents praised the President’s plans as a needed measure to boost American trade and improve economic growth. President Stevenson’s free trade approach has generated quite the controversy given his service as Wallace’s Vice President who ran the most protectionist administration in recent history. In addition to this, several unions, chiefly the United Auto Workers (UAW), strongly condemned the proposed trade agreement."
 Stevenson88.24.d:0 "In a ceremony in the White House’s East Room, President Stevenson signed the Trans-Pacific Free Trade Agreement (TPFTA) into law while being accompanied by several former Presidents and supporting Congressional leaders. Free trade activists and many economists have praised this move in light of past uncertainty over how President Stevenson would handle the negotiations, given his past service in the heavily protectionist Wallace administration. On the other side of the aisle, union leaders have come out swinging against President Stevenson, describing the decision as a betrayal of Stevenson’s voters. Additionally, outspoken billionaire and philanthropist Ross Perot has condemned the agreement as a loss of American sovereignty and per rumors, has begun laying the groundwork for a Presidential campaign in 1992."
 Cuba80s_Ref.0.d:0 "THE CUBAN REFUGEE CRISIS: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nCuba Desk, Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe continuing economic deterioration in Cuba has raised alarms over new waves of Cuban refugees attempting to enter the nation. The prior Mariel Boatlift is a reminder of the risks involved with either option, especially given the political backlash to prior events. From a macro perspective, the Cuban exodus is a positive in terms of displaying the superiority of the free world over Communist regimes along with further damaging the reputation of the Cuban regime. With that said, domestic political concerns should be considered as well. The prior decision to admit Cuban refugees was widely unpopular with the American public and led to a backlash against not just Cuban refugees but against the usage of the Spanish language and even rioting in African-American sections of Miami over perceived issues of preferential treatment. Another consideration with this issue is that if we grant further asylum status to Cubans the administration will likely be called upon by the Congressional Black Caucus to extend these same protections to Haitian migrants as well or be attacked for racial bias. While giving these concessions may placate African-Americans this would surely cause an even greater backlash among the broader public, especially in the South.\n\nOverall, the question becomes do we prioritize the international struggle against Communism or domestic political concerns, how should we proceed?"
 Cuba80s_Ref.1.d:0 "After the decision was made to deny the admission of further Cuban refugees, Chief of Staff [GetCurrentCoS], advocated for scheduling the announcement on a Friday evening to minimize press coverage of the announcement. While the policy overall has a positive approval rating from the majority of voters, certain influential electoral blocs and advocacy groups heavily oppose the policy on the basis of foreign policy and humanitarianism. The administration has also come under fire from the Congressional Black Caucus for also not accommodating Haitian refugees as well as continuing to ignore the growing crisis in Haiti./n/nIn terms of foreign reactions, the Cuban government has not issued any statements on the matter directly, but Soviet-aligned states have lambasted the announcement as showing the hypocrisy and racism of the United States. Additionally, anti-communist advocacy groups such as the Heritage Foundation have lambasted the administration for allowing domestic concerns to overrule foreign policy concerns."
 Cuba80s_Ref.2.d:0 "In a Friday evening press release, the State Department confirmed that it would deny refugee status to new Cuban refugees. This comes in the wake of a renewed wave of Cuban migrants coming to the United States over the last several years, most notably the 1980 Mariel Boatlift. Given the controversy, public backlash and rioting in response to the admission of the Cuban refugees the announcement does not come to a surprise to the general American Public. That said, opposition to the announcement has made for odd-bedfellows with liberal pro-immigration organizations and right wing anti-communist proponents, notably the Heritage Foundation./n/nPublic polling in the wake of the decision shows a notable increase in support for the current administration with the exception of New York and Florida."
 Cuba80s_Ref.3.d:0 "After the decision was made to accommodate the admission of further Cuban refugees, Chief of Staff [GetCurrentCoS], advocated for scheduling the announcement on a Friday evening to minimize press coverage of the announcement. Unfortunately, the attempt to minimize the reaction to the announcement was largely a failure. The general public widely disapproved of the announcement due to the prior issues with past waves of Cuban refugees. If this was not bad enough, rioting has once again broken out in African-American neighborhoods of Miami over claims of preferential treatment of Cubans over African-Americans and Haitian refugees./n/nWith this said, Cuban advocacy groups, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and anti-communist advocacy groups such as the Heritage Foundation have praised the move as a humanitarian imperative and a means of demonstrating the failures of Marxist-Lenninism.\n\nThe Cuban government has not put out any official statements regarding the announcement nor has any other Moscow-aligned state. That said, rumors abound that the Cuban government is once again attempting to ensure that criminals and homosexuals are a large number of the refugees along with political dissenters."
 Cuba80s_Ref.4.d:0 "Once again, Washington has announced that they will accept Cuban refugees that we allow to leave. While perhaps politically embarrassing, this provides a great opportunity, especially with the ongoing economic and agricultural issues to deal with various undesirable groups within the country. Ideally, we should seek to release violent criminals, political dissidents and homosexuals into being the prime groups leaving for the United States. While it is unfortunate that it must come to this, by simply exporting our problematic groups, we can help stabilize the economic and political situation in the country as well as potentially destabilize the United States and provide us with more areas to criticize America in the future. Already the signs of racial unrest growing from the acceptance of the "refugees” is perhaps a sign that this could work for our benefit in the long run…"
 USAOpera.1.d:0 "OPERATION OPERA: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nIsrael Desk, Bureau of South Asian Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nOn June 7th, the Israeli Air Force launched a successful strike on the Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center in Iraq. Intelligence previously confirmed the presence of a nuclear reactor at the facility which could be utilized by the Iraqi nuclear program. To complicate matters, Israel has not only taken credit for the strikes but has stated that this is not an anomaly but a precedent for future actions establishing what is becoming known as the Begin Doctrine. This has sparked a firestorm of international criticism of the Israel government, with the public nature of the strikes the administration can not simply ignore the operation. On one hand, the US could support the strikes, further deepening our ties with Israel. This move would surely be supported by the American Jewish community and could be electorally useful but such a move would put the United States seriously out of step with the rest of the international community including the majority of our allies. Alternatively, we could condemn the operation, being a flagrant violation of international sovereignty, and such a move could be beneficial for our foreign policy on the whole. However, such a move would surely deteriorate our relations with Israel along with alienating Jewish voters and interest groups domestically.\n\nThis is a tough choice for the administration, forced to toe a dangerous line between continuing international norms or supporting a crucial ally in the region. How shall we choose?"
 USAOpera.2.d:0 "In a meeting with the American Ambassador after the completion of Operation Opera, we have been informed that the American government had no choice but to condemn our successful operation. While unfortunate, our intelligence indicates that this will likely not seriously affect our long term relations with Washington and is worth the cost of ensuring that Iraq does not obtain nuclear weapons along with establishing a precedent for future operations. That said, it may be best to either ensure alternative suppliers or adjust our foreign policy to become more compliant with American interests if we desire to continue obtaining American aid. Alternatively, we could aim to bolster pro-Israeli political sentiment in the United States with the large Jewish diaspora located in the United States, predominantly in electorally important states for the upcoming 1984 elections. How shall we choose."
 USAOpera.4.d:0 "Unfortunately, the American Ambassador in a meeting earlier today, informed us that the United States will be temporarily suspending military shipments in light of Operation Opera, along with the government's rhetoric in the aftermath of the strikes. The Ambassador assured us that this is only a temporary measure to appease the general public and international community and that military shipments will resume in time.  This set of events further indicates that the US may not be the most reliable partner if we wish to continue our operations in the Arab states. As the conflict in Lebanon worsens we may need to determine if our operations are worth the cost of alienating our key international ally."
 USAOpera.11.d:0 "In a statement from the American State Department earlier today, the American government confirmed their support for our operation against the Iraqi nuclear program as a needed measure to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. While the majority of the international community has condemned the strikes, the US support of the operation should ensure that pushes in the United Nations for sanctions against us will be vetoed. With this support established, further operations should be considered to debilitate the capacity of Arab states to establish nuclear programs. Furthermore, this could be a signal of future American material support for the developing conflict in Lebanon."
 USAOpera.12.d:0 "The American Ambassador informed the government today that the United States would be immediately increasing its military shipments in light of Operation Opera and the conflict in Lebanon. Given that several nations have halted weapon sales to our nation in light of our recent operations, this is truly excellent news for the nation's security, and additionally signals future political support for our cause. Given the increasing publicity of the Palestinian and Lebanese conflicts, this should ensure that the United Nations will be unable to place sanctions against us. That said, the reaction has been mostly positive but has shown an increasing bloc of opponents of Israel in the American public, especially among the left flank of the Democratic Party, this may necessitate the need to keep deeper tabs on political developments in the United States to ensure our national security. Overall, while this is excellent news and will surely aid us in our struggle against the Arab states, we should strive to not become dependent on the United States in light of potential political shifts in the nation."
 USAOpera.3.d:0 "In a speech at the United Nations today, the American Ambassador condemned the Israeli strikes against nuclear facilities in Iraq. The Ambassador argued that while Israel has a right to defend itself in light of history and geopolitical situation, the move was a gross overextension and abuse of international sovereignty and law. The statement came as a shock to many given America’s past defense of Israel over the last decade but largely falls in line with the current international sentiment. Given the international backlash to the Israeli operation, several nations have called for sanctions against Israel. While America may have condemned the strikes most pundits and analysts do not believe the United States will back the sanction effort."
 USAOpera.10.d:0 "In a press conference earlier today, US President [USA.GetLeader] announced the White House’s support for Israeli strikes against the Iraqi nuclear program. The President argued that Israel acted in self-defense, signaling that the Iraqi nuclear program was a threat to Israel. Domestically, the announcement was largely met with tepid approval by the general public and applauded by Israeli advocacy groups. That said, the announcement puts America against the majority of the international community; which has condemned the operation as a flagrant violation of international law, with America further deepening its ties with Israel. WIth that established, the push to sanction Israel in the United Nations is surely doomed to be vetoed by Washington."
 ETH.USA80.1.d:0 "THE ETHIOPIAN FAMINE: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nEthiopia Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe years following the end of the Second World War and the liberation of Ethiopia has not been kind to said nation. Years of drought in the 1950s and 1960s were followed by political turmoil resulting in the overthrow of the monarchy by Marxist-Lenninist forces in the military leading to a muti-way civil war in the nation. Due to a combination of weather, government policies and the raging civil war, Ethiopia has sunk into an even greater famine. Outside of ignoring the ongoing famine and humanitarian crisis our options are rather limited. Given the main opposition to the Provisional Military Administration Council (PMAC), otherwise known as the Derg is the Tigray People;s Liberation Front, another communist organization, any aid provided will likely end up in either communist controlled faction. With this in mind our options are to either coordinate with other nation and relief groups already providing aid into the nation and accept the risk of interception by the various factions in the war, or alternatively, we could establish an Inter-Agency Task Force on the famine to further deliberate what the best course of action would be in regards to the ongoing crisis."
 ETH.USA80.2.d:0 "The ongoing famine in Ethiopia stemming from the brutal civil war raging presents an opportunity to influence affairs in Ethiopia. To determine whom we shall be aiding and our best course of action we have established the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Africa Famine. The committee is composed of representatives from the Agency of International Development, the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Agriculture and headed by retired generalJulius Bectin.\n\nWhile publicly of course we will assure the public that politics has no bearing on ensuring food is delivered to the affected populace, this presents a prime opportunity to influence the major factions in Ethiopia towards a more western stance. If this is either ineffective or undesirable, the taskforce should seek to find proper anti-communist figures to support and bolster to create a new armed faction within the nation with the goal of establishing a significant pro-western faction within the nation to further advance American interests in the horn of Africa. Overall, the Ethiopian famine is a tragedy that should be addressed due to moral concerns but also presents the government a unique opportunity to advance our interests in the region."
 ETH.USA80.3.d:0 "As the civil war continues to rage on and famine continues to plague our nation, various aid groups and western nations have provided relief efforts to the nation. That said, given the worst of the famine is in rebel occupied areas this presents a problem. By accepting the aid and allowing the free distribution of the aid in the worst hit areas will directly benefit the TPLF and undermine our efforts of containing their forces and limiting their resources in the famine stricken regions in Tigray and Wollo. On the other hand, rejecting the aid would present a serious problem in terms of further weakening our international position. With this in mind, we have three options, we allow the aid workers to enter rebel held regions to distribute aid to relieve the famine, actively establishing checkpoints and procedures to allow for the interception of the foreign aid prior to arriving in TPLF territories or we could simply reject the aid and seek further support from Cuba and the Soviet Union."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.0.d:0 "THE POLITICS OF FAMINE: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nEthiopia Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe ongoing famine and civil war in Ethiopia continues to present unique challenges and opportunities for our African policies. While we have provided humanitarian aid to Ethiopia in recent years, multiple shipments, especially to rebel occupied territory which is the worst affected area of the nation in terms of the drought and famine. Unfortunately both the main rebel faction, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and military government are self-professed ideologically Marxist-Lenninist and are unlikely to be overly susceptible to siding with our government, especially as the government is supported by the Soviet Union and Cuba. This leaves us with two primary options in terms of future aid shipments to the beleaguered nation. First we could simply continue sending humanitarian aid and slowly increase aid as to show compassion for the humanitarian crisis and tacitly ignore issues with the government of Ethiopia and TPLF and attempt to encourage peace talks, alternatively we could cut off humanitarian aid to Ethiopia and place the blame on the Ethiopian government and try to shift blame for the conflict and famine on the failed policies of the communist regime. How should we proceed?"
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.1.d:0 "As we continue supplying humanitarian aid to Ethiopia it is imperative we continually evaluate the efficacy of the program. While assuredly the provided humanitarian aid has helped to at least marginally reduce the ongoing suffering of Ethiopian civilians there has been various concerns and irregularities reported by officials. By all accounts, many aid shipments into the interior of the country towards the more affected, rebel occupied regions have been intercepted by both government forces along with TPLF forces for their own personal use or redistributed to their supporters elsewhere. Given the political leanings of both of these factions, this raises the point of if we should be indirectly aiding communist forces. Unfortunately, we do not have the capability to stop these interdictions so the question becomes do we stop aid shipments entirely or not? Either choice will have major consequences on our Ethiopian policy going forward."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.2.d:0 "Washington has informed our government today that the American government would be suspending famine relief to our nation. The communique also indicated that the Americans plan to push the blame of their decision off on our government for supposedly intercepting a number of relief shipments being sent to rebel occupied territory. This will surely further inflame tensions within the country, but does has its upsides, given the famine is at its worst in the rebel occupied territory the TPLF will be subject to having further deal with the famine instead of directing all their forces at us.Additionally, the foreign ministry should seek to spin the situation and shift blame to America and the TPLF for sacrificing African lives at the altar of anti-communism and intercepting aid shipments respectively. Overall, while this is certainly a blow to the nation as a whole, there is definite upsides to interrupting famine relief to the countryside to shift the tides of the war in our favor."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.3.d:0 "In a statement today, Washington confirmed that America would be halting humanitarian aid to Ethiopia due to repeated interdiction of supplies by the various factions in the civil war. The statement went on to argue that the administration wished to provide further humanitarian aid but did not trust the government in Ethiopia to allow the aid to enter affected regions and did not wish to supply the communist regime in Addis Ababa with further supplies. The Ethiopian government denied the reports that they had intercepted supplies and shifted blame onto the TPLF. Humanitarian organizations slammed the announcement as an abandonment of the people of Ethiopia by the American government and a weaponization of humanitarian aid during a humanitarian crisis."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.4.d:0 "After much deliberation, the State Department in concurrence with the President has decided the best course forward in Ethiopia is to continue and expand our humanitarian aid to Ethiopia. While the interception of aid by the government is a noted problem, the benefits of continuing assistance outweighs the diverted aid shipments. The State Department also noted that halting aid would likely be heavily criticized by the international community and would be seen as attempting to politicize an ongoing humanitarian disaster and would surely be utilized in propaganda by the Soviet Union to be used against us, especially in other Africa nations affected by the ongoing wave of droughts plaguing Sub-Saharan Africa. Overall, the humanitarian aid provided to Ethiopia has a miniscule financial cost to our government and is a notable goodwill building measure to aid in addressing a mass humanitarian crisis. Additionally, providing aid allows our surrogates to argue that the crisis was exacerbated by failed communist policies yet we are still giving humanitarian aid to try to alleviate the worst of the famine."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.5.d:0 "In a diplomatic communique received earlier today, American diplomats informed us that Washington would be expanding its humanitarian aid program in our nation. With that said, the communications also included a request that we stop interfering with aid shipments into rebel occupied.territories. For years, one of our weapons in the civil war has been to exacerbate the famine in rebel held territories including by redirecting aid shipments meant for said areas to our own supporters in other regions. This has allowed us to preserve support in our core territories along with weakening rebel territories and potential recruits. That said, ending the policy would surely provide us with much needed international goodwill. Regardless, the pending announcement will surely help us relieve the worst impacts of the continuing famine plaguing the nation."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.6.d:0 "In a statement today, Washington announced that they would be expanding their shipments of humanitarian aid to Ethiopia. The statement has been met positively by the American public but has raised the ire of the more militant anti-communist organizations such as the Heritage Foundation who criticized the administration’s lack of action towards the interception of supplies by the Ethiopian government.Washington did note that this was a major current problem with the current supply of humanitarian aid to the affected populace in Ethiopia, especially in rebel held territories but acknowledged that there was no way of stopping of this without withholding aid altogether which would only harm the Ethiopian people. The Ethiopian government denied the reports of interception and blamed the rebels for the disruptions in humanitarian aid."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.7.d:0 "In a missive from the American State Department, Washington has expressed interest in establishing a neutral venue for peace talks between ourselves and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Any negotiated peace agreement will likely lead to us ceding at least some amount of power and likely sacrificing the territorial integrity of the nation. On the other hand, at least entertaining the idea of peace talks should boost our international reputation and give time for our Cuban and Soviet allies to resupply our military for future offensives against the TPLF. Alternatively, if we actually do desire to try to bring the conflict to the close at the negotiating table rather than the field then this would be a solid opportunity to work towards that outcome."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.8.d:0 "Our diplomatic representatives in Ethiopia related to our government earlier today that the Ethiopian military government would be open to peace talks with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Given the TPLF’s stance on negotiations already being established this should hopefully lead to the beginning of peace talks in the near future. That said, the various issues behind the civil war and Eritrean Independence War are complex and will not be easily dealt with at the negotiating table, this effort will require extensive amounts of expertise and attention to get off the ground. Fortunately the first step has been taken and the Ethiopian government is now willing to entertain peace talks, hopefully this will lead to a ceasefire in the near future. Ifn this develops positively, this will surely be a major win for our foreign policy strategies in Africa and should boost our domestic and international standing."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.9.d:0 "Our diplomatic representatives in Ethiopia related to our government earlier today that the Ethiopian government would not be open to peace talks and restarted their belief that negotiating with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front was pointless as the government sees the territorial integrity of the nation as inviolable. While this decision is not surprising, it is a disappointment, the administration held hope that the increased willingness for the Ethiopian government to coordinate relief efforts and engage with our government was a possible step towards a diplomatic resolution to the conflict, alas the civil war is set to rage on for years to come."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.10.d:0 "In a surprising announcement, the American Secretary of State [USA.GetCurrentSecState] announced that Washington had brokered the start of peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). This comes after further American humanitarian aid into the beleaguered nation along with various diplomatic outreaches to both major sides of the ongoing conflict. While a ceasefire has not been declared, this is still being heralded as a major step towards peace in the region. Critics on the other hand criticized the talks as ignoring the secondary conflict in the nation, that of the Eritrean struggle for independence which has raged on since the early 1960s."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.11.d:0 "Excellent news from Washington, American diplomats through backchannels have informed us that America plans to recognize us as the legitimate government of Ethiopia. Our recent strategy of attempting to attract American support by moderating our rhetoric and condemning the Soviet and Cuban support for the DERG and drawing comparisons to our struggle to that of UNITA in Angola has been a major factor in this announcement. With American recognition, and hopefully aid, we should be able to break the current stalemate in the conflict and crush the DERG once and for all and bring the Eritrean conflict to a conclusion as well. That said, there will surely be a price to be paid for American support post-war and we will likely be forced to open our economy to foreign investment and business and chart a pro-western foreign policy. Regardless, this is excellent news for our struggle and will hopefully be the turning point and beginning of our final push to victory."
 ETH_USA_FAMINE.12.d:0 "In a press conference today, by American Secretary of State [USA.GetCurrentSecState] announced that the United States would be recognizing the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) as the legitimate government of Ethiopia. This comes after America has greatly expanded its offers and outreach in the famine and war ravaged African nation. While both main sides in the conflict have been officially self-described as Marxist-Lennist, the TPLF has moderated heavily since American involvement in the conflict and their actions to curry American support have paid off. With that said, while a diplomatic solution is possibly in sight, the conflict still rages on."
 Ethiopian_Contra84.0.d:0 "ETHIOPIAN RESISTANCE: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nEthiopia Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Ethiopia would in an ideal world be a potent conflict to turn into a proxy war to rollback communism in Africa. Unfortunately the two major factions in the civil war, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and DERG officially identify as Marxist-Lenninist and would not make suitable proxies on an ideological level. Unfortunately, most of the more friendly factions in the civil war were either absorbed, sidelined or crushed early in the conflict.\n\nRecently, Jonas Deressa, the head of an Ethiopian humanitarian organization and a leader of the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Alliance (EPDA) along with his brother Dereje Deressa have been lobbying for American support. The EPDA is notably a more traditionalist group ideologically and would certainly be amicable to our interests and influence. Furthermore, the EPDA is heavily backed by various hawks in the Congress and backed by anti-communist advocacy groups such as the Heritage Foundation. We could seek to back the group with information warfare assistance, intelligence, training and weapons but doing so would certainly take quite the political and financial cost given our involvement in other conflicts and relative popularity of further involvement in yet another conflict. How should we proceed?"
 Ethiopian_Contra84.1.d:0 "In a press conference today, President [USA.GetLeader) announced that Washington would be recognizing the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Alliance and actively seeking to arm and supply the organization along with its humanitarian wing. The EPDA, led by the brothers Jonas and Dereje Deressa are noted darlings of the Heritage Foundation and other anti-communist advocacy groups in the United States over the last year and the President noted that the goal was to turn the EPDA into a capable military force and establish them as an anti-communist alternative to the incumbent government and Tigray People’s Liberation Front. The announcement was condemned by the Soviet Union and Cuba as another example of American brinkmanship, both states are noted for being supporters of the current Ethiopian government."
 USA_MOBUTU.1.d:0 "DISCONTENT IN ZAIRE: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nZaire Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe western friendly government in Zaire represents our main line of defense against further communist encroachment on Sub-Saharan Africa. That said, the government's appalling record on human rights, endemic corruption and borderline cult of personality directed towards President Mobutu represent potential trigger points for future conflict within the nation which would likely lead to an escalatory spiral throughout the region. With this in mind, we should consider applying pressure on the Zairean government to begin reforms to rectify this situation and mitigate the potential of future unrest. Alternatively, we may need to consider what our future in the region will entail in a post-Mobutu Central Africa if no measures are taken."
 Mobutu84.0.d:0 "THE FUTURE OF ZAIRE: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nZaire Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAs the decade continues, it has become increasingly clear that President Mobutu will not willing reform the nation or take measures to deal with the endemic corruption plaguing the nation. With this likelihood, we have two main approaches possible. On one hand we could attempt to push for reforms and cut our losses for now, or we could continue to further intensify military aid to Zaire along with financial aid. While perhaps kicking the can down the road, the second option could possibly allow for future attempts to utilize Zaire for operations in Angola and any other communist neighbor of the nation. Additionally, the suspension of aid to Zaire could seriously destabilize the nation which would jeopardize our various African strategies and risk the future expansion of communism in Africa. How should we proceed?"
 Mobutu84.1.d:0 "In a meeting with the American ambassador earlier today, it was pressed by the Americans that Washington desires for us to accede to their requests for various humanitarian and political reforms within our nation. These include reducing the powers of the state and reigning in the various "repressive” organs of the state as well as moving to dismantle the claimed "personality cult” in President Mobutu along with a smattering of economic liberalization actions.While not outright stated, the ambassador heavily implied that future support was contingent upon our acceptance of the various American reform proposals. This raises a major issue, if we go along with the reforms we will be ultimately undermining our own power base but if we refuse the aid the end of American aid will heavily destabilize the nation, either choice presents potential issues for our continued long term rule over Zaire."
 Mobutu84.2.d:0 "Great news from Zaire, our embassy in Kinshasa relayed a message from President Mobutu signaling that the Zairean government will accede to the various reform proposals that we had sent to Zaire over the last several months. This should signal a shift in policy by the Sub-Saharan nation and should lead to a more stable Zaire by attempting to reign in the endemic corruption issue and bringing some level of democratic reforms. With the continual spread of communism in the region especially after the Portugal departure from the continent, preserving the Mobutu regime is of the utmost importance. Failure to stabilize the regime will likely have dire consequences and could easily lead to Zaire either imploding into anarchy or falling into the hands of the communists, neither of which are palatable outcomes for our administration."
 Mobutu84.3.d:0 "Unfortunate news from Zaire, our embassy in Kinshasa relayed a message from President Mobutu noting that the Zairean government will decline to implement the various reform proposals that we had sent to Zaire over the last several months. This unfortunately signals that the government prioritizes kleptocracy and corruption over the wellbeing of the nation and citizenry. With the continual spread of communism in the region especially after the Portugal departure from the continent, preserving the Mobutu regime is of the utmost importance. Failure to stabilize the regime will likely have dire consequences and could easily lead to Zaire either imploding into anarchy or falling into the hands of the communists, neither of which are palatable outcomes for our administration. The refusal of the Mobutu regime to implement common sense reforms and tackle endemic corruption only makes this strategy harder and costlier to continue as time passes."
 Mobutu84.4.d:0 "While far from perfect, President Mobutu Sese Seko has been a stalwart and faithful for the United States for decades and has been one of the key figures in keeping Zaire stable after the end of the Congo Crisis and civil wars of the 1960s. That said, the issues with the Zairean army displayed through the last decade, especially during the attempted Angolan intervention show that there is much work to be done in shoring up one of our key allies in Africa. Unfortunately, President Mobutu has come under fire from various international and domestic groups due to Zaire’s endemic corruption, crippling poverty rates and authoritarian tendencies. Mobutu has also been willing to toe our line in regard to South Africa, which in turn has provided some level of legitimacy to our actions in southern Africa. To repay this and ensure the future stability of the region, we should invite President Mobutu to the White House to push his case to the American people along with increasing financial and military aid to Zaire."
 Mobutu84.5.d:0 "During a visit of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko to Washington today, President [USA.GetLeader] announced further American support for Zaire as a voice of reason in Francophone Africa and praised their continued relations with other American allies including Israel and South Africa. While the President praised Zaire for its anti-communist stances and pro-western foreign policy, domestic critics of the Mobutu regime criticized the hosting of Mobutu due to the various human rights abuses reported in Zaire along with the rumored misappropriation of American financial aid to the African nation due to the endemic corruption plaguing Zaire. Regardless, the administration seems set on continuing to utilize Zaire for its efforts to contain communism in the region."
 Mobutu84.6.d:0 "As we continue to invest in Mobutu, Zaire has quickly become our sole bulwark against communism in Francophone Africa and our main ally in sub-saharan barring the controversial South Africa. With this in mind, we should escalate our efforts to modernize and reform the Zairean Armed Forces with the intent to ensure the stability of Zaire along with the potential to either rebuff communist attempts to restart civil conflict within the nation. Given the poor performance of the Zairean forces in the 1960s and 1970s this is all the more imperative. Perhaps if enough effort is spent in reforming and equipping the Zairean forces into a capable force we should request renewed intervention in the Angolan Civil War on behalf of UNITA?"
 Mobutu84.7.d:0 "As noted in prior assessments, the uptick in American support for our regime will likely lead to us being requested to intervene in regional conflicts on behalf of Washington. Over the last day, the American ambassador has passed along a message from Washington noting that the American government desired for Zaire to launch a renewed intervention in Angola on behalf of UNITA forces fighting against the communist government. Now this provides us with quite the opportunity, if the intervention is successful we would likely be able to press our claims to the oil-rich Cabinda exclave and have a level of influence in the new Angolan government. Unfortunately our prior attempt at intervention was a decisive disaster for our forces due to a variety of factors, notably the presence of Cuban forces bolstering the MPLA. Additionally, another military misadventure would likely embolden our domestic opponents and could destabilize our rule, how should we proceed?"
 Mobutu84.8.d:0 "Excellent news recently arrived from our ambassador to Zaire, President Mobutu informed the ambassador during a routine meeting that he would approve renewed intervention into Angola against the MPLA in support of UNITA. This news comes after our renewed focus on modernizing the Zairean military and expanding our funding for Mobutu’s regime. While there are still plenty of concerns over the actual efficacy of the Zaire forces, especially in light of their prior misadventures, this could be a decisive moment in the history of the region regardless of outcomes. A successful intervention could signal the start of pushing back communist influence in Africa and a validation of our African foreign policy strategy of recent years, or in the case of failure result in renewed unrest in Zaire and possibly signal the beginning of the end for the Mobutu regime."
 Mobutu84.9.d:0 "Unfortunate news recently arrived from our ambassador to Zaire. President Mobutu informed the ambassador that the government would reject the proposed renewed intervention into Angola. Mobutu argued that while ideally Zaire would be able to, that realities on the ground would make such a move too costly and risk instability in his nation. Concerts were particularly raised over the continued presence of Cuban forces in Angola which notably were a major contributor to Zaire’s defeat in the prior intervention in Angola a decade ago. Another concern was that by committing the Zairean military to Angola would leave the nation vulnerable to neighboring powers along with domestic resistance groups such as the People’s Revolutionary Party (PRP)."
 Mobutu84.10.d:0 "Hours ago the Armed Forces of Zaire stormed the Angolan border launching a push south towards Luanda, accompanied by a major bombing campaign carried out by the Zairean Air Force. The US State Department announced their support of the apparent intervention and further praised the continued struggle of UNITA forces against the governing MPLA forces backed notably by a large contingent of Cuban forces. This comes a decade after the infamous attempted intervention on behalf of the Zaire-backed FNLA in northern Angola which was decisively defeated by joint MPLA-Cuban forces. That said, in recent years the United States has heavily invested in reforming and modernizing the Zairean military and by all accounts UNITA is a more capable force then the FNLA."
 Mobutu84.11.d:0 "President Mobutu of Zaire visited the Angolan capital of Luanda today and declared victory in an address to Zairean and UNITA soldiers in regard to the Angolan Civil War. This marks a sharp reversal from the prior decades intervention where Zairean forces were routed while attempting to advance towards Luanda by a joint Cuban-MPLA force. While Jonas Savimi, head of UNITA also declared victory in the conflict he noted that the MPLA forces were still actively fighting an insurgent war and were still receiving supplies from Cuba and the Soviets and more military will be needed from the United States. Regardless this is a major victory for Washington in southern Africa."
 Mobutu84.12.d:0 "With the rout of the Zairean army from northern Angola, the second round of Zairean intervention in Angola came to a decisive end. Not only did the intervention fail but the reduction in internal security has led to the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) composed primarily by former Lumumbists and led by Laurent-Désiré Kabila to quickly expand. The PRP based out of South Kivu, was able to rapidly break out of the region during the failed intervention in Angola by the Zairean Armed Forces and has led to a general breakdown of national cohesion with various warlords seizing areas of the country as well. The rapidly deteriorating situation in the nation has put the international community on alert as once again Congo is on the brink of civil war."
 Mobutu84.13.d:0 "In light of our ongoing problems plaguing the nation, Washington has made an interesting proposal. The American ambassador noted that America was willing to provide substantial amounts of humanitarian, economic and military aid in exchange for making major reforms within the nation in relation to democratization, human rights and cracking down on corruption. As our country hangs on a precipice once more this package could be the difference between stabilization and renewed civil war. That said, agreeing to the reforms would surely reduce our own internal security and decrease our personal power over the nation and could lead to future peaceful transfer of power against the government. Additionally, the ambassador also noted that if we reject the proposal and that the nation falls into civil war that we should not take American involvement as a certainty. How should we proceed?"
 Mobutu84.14.d:0 "Our embassy in Kinshasa earlier today informed our administration that President Mobutu has accepted our combined aid and reform package. While Zaire is one of our key allies in Africa, the state of the government leaves much to be desired, between ethnic tension, endemic corruption, military incompetence and a dismal economy the chance of future instability is quite high. Thankfully, the package of aid and democratic reforms that President Mobutu has committed to enacting should hopefully stabilize the nation and lead to a stronger Zaire which can better influence the region against communism. The Mobutu government may seek to slowly enact or undermine these reforms, we should trust but verify the reforms as they are enacted and intervene when necessary to ensure the proper timeline is kept."
 Mobutu84.15.d:0 "Our embassy in Kinshasa earlier today informed our administration that President Mobutu has refused our combined aid and reform package.  While Zaire is one of our key allies in Africa, the state of the government leaves much to be desired, between ethnic tension, endemic corruption, military incompetence and a dismal economy the chance of future instability is quite high. Unfortunately with President Mobutu rejecting our proposed aid and reform package the chances for future instability in the nation only increase. Renewed crises and tension in Zaire would surely undermine our African policy and strategic goals as well as lead to the expansion of communist influence in Sub-Saharan Africa. If the worst comes, we will need to consider whether to militarily intervene in a hypothetical conflict in the beleaguered African nation."
 Mobutu84.16.d:0 "Our misadventure in Angola has once again come at a great cost. With the military deployed to Angola, security forces were pulled out of the eastern region of the nation which was capitalized on by insurgent forces and ethnic militias, in particular the Lumumbist People’s Revolutionary Party (PRP). Thankfully our ambassador in Washington has relayed back earlier today that the Americans would be providing security and financial aid to help stabilize the situation, while we would appreciate more concrete steps such as security guarantees, the amount of aid being offered should be enough to at least prevent the worst potential outcomes currently and also signals that if the worst comes America will at least extend further military aid."
 Mobutu84.17.d:0 "Terrible news, our ambassador in Washington has informed us that America is planning to mask any involvement in our failed intervention in Angola and will likely be withholding any aid or support for our ongoing internal issues. This is quite the catastrophe for our government, without further aid the situation will surely continue to destabilize within the nation. Already rumblings of renewed local offensives by the People’s Revolutionary Party (PRP) are rumored in South Kivu and rising ethnic tensions in the eastern reaches of the nation has been reported as well."
 Mobutu84.18.d:0 "Treachery! After our repeated intervention in Angola, support for Pretoria and pro-western foreign policy, Washington has abandoned us to our fate in the ongoing civil war. Without American aid or intervention our position is quite dire. Given that our neighbors seem keen on deposing our regime the only option we have is to defeat Kabila’s forces in the field and seek to either enlist the help of the various ethnic militias in the eastern reaches of the country or crush them into submission to our authority. If we can not defeat the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) in the field or other nations launch interventions against us we should consider fleeing the country to preserve our heads and leave the nation to its fates under Kabila or foreign occupation."
 Mobutu84.19.d:0 "With the decision finalized in recent days to launch armed intervention in the Congo we now need to establish plans, contingencies, strategies and evaluate logistics for the campaign. The overall goal of the intervention will be to prevent the collapse of the state along with ensuring that the People’s Revolutionary Party (PRP) forces are unable to topple the regime. This will be accomplished by propping up the government of Mobutu Sese Seko, launching attacks on PRP positions in the eastern reaches of the country and negotiating with local forces where possible to prevent further slippage to the leftist insurgents. Given the unique topography of the target, special attention will need to be placed on logistics, we will need to ensure that the port of Matadi is properly secured and will likely need to establish new airbases in the interior of the nation to hasten progress and ensure the full utilization of our air power against the enemy. Finally, another concern is that of public relations, given the nature of the conflict being against Lumumbists, parallels will surely be drawn to the earlier Congo Crisis of the 1960s to criticize our intervention as an imperialist ploy to further subvert Sub-Saharan African sovereignty, to counter this we need to ensure to demonstrate to the American people via the media the various atrocities occurring in the nation to justify the intervention."
 Mobutu84.20.d:0 "Thankfully, the American ambassador informed us earlier today that America would be militarily intervening in our civil war. Given we are in this current predicament due to our failed intervention in Angola, which was encouraged by the United States, this is the least that Washington could do for us in our time of need. Preparations will need to be taken in advance of the American intervention, to start with we should ensure the security and maintenance of the port of Matadi given the city will likely become a major logistics hub in the near future. Given the geographic extent and poor rural infrastructure of our nation, it is also imperative that the roads between major cities and Matadi are evaluated and repaired where necessary. Furthermore, the same process should be undertaken for the various air bases located throughout the nation. While the civil war has been difficult so far, hopefully this will be the decisive turning point in the war and lead to the final destruction of the Lumumbists."
 Mobutu84.21.d:0 "In a televised address, President [USA.GetLeader] announced that American forces would be intervening in the ongoing civil war in the Congo in support of the forces of President Mobutu. The current crisis is a result of the failed Zairean intervention in the Angolan Civil War, with the Zairean government forces entangled in Angola, the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) was able to break out of South Kivu and rapidly expand its held territories across the eastern Congo. President [USA.GetLeader] argued that a PRP victory in the conflict would quickly lead to neighboring nations in the region falling to communism as well and send the broader region into deeper chaos."
 USA_ZAIRE88.0.d:0 "AMERICAN INFLUENCE IN ZAIRE: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nZaire Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nSince the days of the Congo Crisis Mobutu Sese Seko has been our man in the Congo. That said, as the years pass more and more scandals and issues with Mobutu’s regime have become apparent. Rampant corruption in the government has eroded any semblance of popular support in the country and various failed military escapades by the nation have failed to bolster our shared ambitions in Angola. The continual failures of the government in Zaire is compounded by the atrocious  human rights record of the Mobutu regime. With the problems stacking up Mobutu has perhaps become a liability to our affairs in Africa. On one hand, we could double down and intensify our support for Mobutu and expand our military aid shipments to the nation. While this could help to contain communism in the region, the past military misadventures of the nation should be taken into account. Alternatively, we could cut off support for Mobutu and seek to either depose Mobutu in favor of a more competent alternative or coerce the regime into making government reforms in terms of human rights. That said, this option may lead to destabilizing the broader region in a worst case scenario."
 USA_ZAIRE88.1.d:0 "Great news from Washington, the American ambassador signaled earlier today that President [USA.GetLeader] has authorized increased levels of military support to our nation. While the opposition in America has called for reducing or even eliminating aid to our glorious nation, the current administration has noted that we are indeed their "Man in Africa”. We should seek to exploit this for everything we can. Given the prior instability within the nation along with the conflicts to our south, it is imperative we ensure a well equipped, large military force. That said, the American diplomats also noted that the CIA is taking a deeper look at the conflict in Angola and we may be once again requested to provide support or even outright intervention into the Angolan Civil War."
 USA_ZAIRE88.2.d:0 "Unfortunate news from Washington, the United States has announced that they will be cutting off all financial support to us. To make matters worse, the Americans have also announced the cancellation of all military contracts and aid to our regime. Washington noted our refusal to deal with the so-called endemic corruption, human rights record and military misadventures are the primary causes of the announcement. The situation will soon become dire given our dependence on American financial aid and with the threat of conflict with communist and ethnic militants will surely rise by the day. This leaves us with little options outside of attempting to rally support from our traditional allies, such as the Kimbanguist Church and perhaps attempting to reform the military to be more effective for the worst case scenario."
 SAF_USA80.0.d:0 "THE SOUTH AFRICAN PROBLEM: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe wave of decolonization in Africa over the last few decades has unfortunately lead to the expansion of communism in the continent. Unfortunately, the remaining anti-communist, western friendly nations in Sub-Saharan Africa leave much to be desired. The primary anti-communist power in the region would be South Africa, unfortunately the nation’s policy of Apartheid makes collaboration quite controversial among both domestic and international audiences. To further complicate the situation, South Africa is one of the major supporters of anti-communist factions in the neighboring nations civil wars, in particular of UNITA in Angola.This leaves us with two options, outright condemning Apartheid and calling on Pretoria to move away from the policy or face sanctions. The alternative proposal has been coined "Constructive Engagement” which would entail trying to diplomatically push South Africa towards reforms through pushing economic engagement with the nation and aiming to stop international measures to sanction South Africa. Either option will entail potentially serious domestic and international political ramifications."
 SAF_USA80.1.d:0 "In recent years, the Anti-Apartheid movement has gained steam across various western nations as well as the call for imposing sanctions against South Africa over its policy of Apartheid along with its continued occupation of Namibia. That said, President [USA.GetLeader]’s announcement today of a new South African policy outlined as "Constructive Engagement” represents a major departure from this trend. The announced policy will focus on trying to use dialogue and positive reinforcements to encourage reforms in South Africa. Anti-Apartheid activists have strongly condemned this policy change arguing that the policy is immoral and violates the moral fabric of the United States while supporters argue that sanctions would harm the poor and could lead to instability in the region."
 SAF_USA80.2.d:0 "As the years go by, more and more nations have come to condemn our government for our policy of Apartheid and supposed minority rule. Unfortunately, the United States has now joined this list of particular concern is what this may have down the line in terms of our economy and military. Given the United States has been the main obstacle in the way of the United Nations implacing sanctions against us as well as our primary foreign arms supplier this is a serious cause for alarm. While we could simply hope that this is simple posturing for domestic audiences in America, we should prepare for the worst case scenario of a withdrawal of American aid along with potentially debilitating sanctions against our economy and government officials."
 SAF_USA80.3.d:0 "In a blistering address earlier today, President [USA.GetLeader] bluntly condemned the South African government for its continued Apartheid policies and minority rule. While Washington had become more critical of South Africa in recent years, this still marks a decisive turning point in American-South African relations, representing the first full denouncement of the current South African government. Leading activists in the Anti-Apartheid movement praised President [USA.GetLeader]’s address and signaled optimism that this could be the beginning of the end for Apartheid. Given Washington’s role in blocking international sanctions against South Africa, this could also represent a turning point in the capability of the Anti-Apartheid movement, time will tell if this is simply a ploy to distract from covert support to South Africa or a genuine change in policy by the American government."
 SAF_USA80.4.d:0 "America has signaled its wishes to engage in a new policy of "Constructive Engagement” with us. The policy would in effect focus on trying to slowly push us for internal reforms in exchange of positive reinforcements and aid. More notably, the Americans have also informed us via the normal back channels that they will seek to veto any efforts to place sanctions on us at the United Nations and seem likely to continue or even increase the level of intelligence sharing regarding the Border War and Angolan Civil War. Regardless of whether or not we wish to push significant structural reforms, this would be a good time to gauge what benefits we can receive in exchange for specific types of reforms along with possibly using said incentives as a means to convince hardliners to push through moderate reforms."
 SAF_USA80.5.d:0 "In a contentious UN session yesterday, the American UN Ambassador announced that they woul;d be vetoing the current package of sanctions for South Africa along with any future attempt to sanction the controversial nation. South Africa praised the announcement as an endorsement of their efforts to contain and rollback communism in southern Africa, in particular in support of its intervention in Angola. The Anti-Apartheid movement condemned the move as a dangerous performative political stunt that will only embolden the South African government. President [USA.GetLeader]’s political opponents and potential challengers in the upcoming election have also weighed in largely criticizing the move and calling for new leadership for America."
 SAF_USA80.6.d:0 "In a communique from the American ambassador, the American government has requested to collaborate in regard to South Africa and the new "Constructive Engagement” policy. In effect, we would be required to join their efforts to come against international sanctions against South Africa and seek to diplomatically engage South Africa to make internal reforms while providing incentives for doing so. Additionally, we would also likely be asked to help in intelligence sharing and covert military aid in regard to the ongoing Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. Cooperating would surely aid in the cause of containing communism in Africa, but presents various moral and political quandaries given the public’s opposition to Apartheid. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.7.d:0 "Thankfully Britain has positively received and agreed to our request to collaborate with us in regard to South Africa. British Prime Minister [ENG.GetLeader] has agreed to seek to build positive dialogue with the government in Pretoria and seek to encourage political reforms in exchange of economic aid. That said, the British are less receptive to efforts to increase their involvement in the armed struggles in southern Africa unfortunately. Regardless, this should help to legitimize our "Constructive Engagement” policy with South Africa and deflect criticisms from the domestic opposition and Anti-Apartheid movement. Additionally, having a major partner in negotiating with South Africa  Overall, the goal remains to push South Africa towards reforms while not endangering the fight against communism in southern Africa."
 SAF_USA80.8.d:0 "Unfortunately Britain has politely rejected our proposal to collaborate on dealing with South Africa. The British government argued that the move would have been politically dangerous for the incumbent government along with noting various moral objections to undermining the sanction effort against South Africa or interfering with the Anti-Apartheid movement. That said this represents a major defeat for our efforts to build an international coalition in support of South Africa and portraying the "Constructive Engagement” policy as a valid alternative to the effort to place sanctions on South Africa. Additionally, without Britain’s support in the United Nations, we will surely come under more fire from both the Eastern Bloc and Anti-Apartheid activists for our moves to shield South Africa from sanctions."
 SAF_USA80.9.d:0 "Recent communications with both London and Washington have demonstrated that both nations' governments should engage with us to promote gradual reforms and economic liberalization measures to bolster the economy. This new policy, titled "Constructive Engagement” is surely better than the alternative of pressure campaigns and sanctions from both of these major powers. That said, going along with "Constructive Engagement” still requires our government to enact at least some level of reforms which will likely be unpopular with hardliners in the government and could be politically risky. Additionally, instituting reforms to marginally reduce Apartheid could embolden the African population to demand more and further radicalize the broader population into the arms of the African National Congress. Refusing on the other hand would surely damage our relations with Washington, our largest remaining ally and could easily lead to more international sanctions against our government being enacted which would be economically ruinous. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.10.d:0 "Pretoria has responded to our offer of "Constructive Engagement” quite positively and has noted that the South African government looks forward to future discourse. This sets up the necessary groundwork to fully begin our policy of "Constructive Engagement” with the South African government's willingness to discuss potential reforms. We can demonstrate any progress made with the South African government as a victory for our policy and administration at home and abroad. Additionally, if this policy succeeds in promoting reforms in South Africa, we will have cover to further blocking international and domestic sanctions against South Africa which would disrupt their fight against communists."
 SAF_USA80.11.d:0 "In an odd turn of events, South Africa has decided to not engage with us in our attempt to grant further legitimacy to their state and avoid international sanctions being placed on the African nation. This comes after the recent turn in South Africa coming from Andries Treurnicht's successful takeover of the Nasionale Party over the more reformist wing previously in power. This decision on Pretoria’s is effectively a death knell to the policy of "Constructive Engagement”, we will now need to decide whether to unilaterally support South Africa regardless of Apartheid or abandon Pretoria and give the communists free reign in southern Africa. Either of these choices will likely result in failing to meet our strategic goals in the region and will surely be controversial with the general American public."
 SAF_USA80.12.d:0 "In a speech to parliament, South African President [SAF.GetLeader] announced that the government would begin dialogue with the United States and United Kingdom on Apartheid and the international struggle against communism with the goal of finding common ground with said nations. President [USA.GetLeader] praised the announcement as a step towards potential reform while defending southern Africa against the perils of communism. On the other side of the aisle, Anti-Apartheid activists, the African National Congress (ANC) and others have criticized the move as simply buying time for the South African government and another gambit to avoid placing sanctions on the nation by Washington."
 SAF_USA80.13.d:0 "An intriguing proposal from Washington was recently sent to our government from Washington. The proposal seeks to establish a regional peace in southern Africa by having the South African government recognize the independence of South West Africa as Namibia and withdraw all military forces from the nation in exchange for the withdrawal of Cuban forces in Angola supporting the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). On one hand, supporting the measure would surely help de-escalate tensions with the west and would secure Namibian independence which is one of our strategic goals in the region. However, withdrawing Cuban support from Angola could have dire consequences on the communist government in Luanda, without Cuban support in the first place it is highly unlikely that the MPLA could have fended off the anti-communist opposition, South Africans and Zairean military intervention.and it is unknown if the MPLA can hold off the opposition in the civil war without their continued presence. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.14.d:0 "Moscow has signaled their approval of our African peace proposal, this has come to a surprise to our government but a welcome one at that. This very well could signal a new trend of decreasing tensions between Washington and Moscow. Ideally the Soviets will help with encouraging Cuba to agree to the proposal as well, but while Cuba is a Soviet ally, by no means are they a Soviet client state and their approval should not be taken for granted. Additionally, convincing South Africa to agree to the proposal may be a challenge in itself given South Africa’s longstanding commitment to keeping South West Africa as part of the nation. Overall, this is a great step towards peace in the region and can hopefully lead to a lasting peace in Namibia and South Africa as well as provide legitimacy to our revised South African policy."
 SAF_USA80.15.d:0 "Unfortunately Moscow has ignored our regional peace plan in southern Africa. While a detailed explanation was not given, analysts in the State Department believe that the answer is relative simple, given the advantage of communist aligned forces in southern Africa, Moscow does not see the point of potentially ceding Angola for South West Africa’s independence, especially without any guarantees on South Africa’s actions in Angola and the broader region after a Cuban withdrawal. Given the increasing amounts of Soviet aid to the Angolan, Mozambican and Ethiopian governments this further demonstrates that Moscow does not intend to negotiate in good faith for a peace plan in the region. Overall, this decision does not come as a particular surprise to the administration but does represent a failure in the "Constructive Engagement” policy given that establishing regional peace in southern Africa was the end strategic goal of the policy."
 SAF_USA80.16.d:0 "Moscow has forwarded an intriguing proposal from the United States that they have signed off on. The proposal is for us to withdraw our forces fighting in Angola in exchange for South Africa granting independence to South West Africa under the South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO) rule. While SWAPO is one of our African allies and the liberation of Namibia is a major goal of our African interventions, it is unclear if the Angolan government can survive against the imperialist opposition if we withdraw our forces from Angola, on the other hand, the loss of Namibia should also reduce South Africa presence and capabilities to intervene in Angola and such a peace agreement would surely help legitimize our past interventions in Africa. On a related note, the proposal was leaked to the Angolan government who have been consequently apoplectic at Moscow for signing off on the proposal, and the potential fall of the government would surely mark our intervention as a long term failure. With this all in consideration, how should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.17.d:0 "Havana has informed us of their intention to agree to our peace proposal for southern Africa and do their part by withdrawing their forces from Angola. The Cuban government did note that the agreement did not bar Cuba from providing material aid to the Angolan government and that they will continue to support their allies in Namibia and Angola through other means. While this will likely be a longer term nuisance, the departure of Cuban forces represents a major loss in fighting capability for the communist Angolan government and should enable the opposition to regain momentum in the nation’s lengthy civil war. The Cuban government also signaled their willingness for further discourse on other regional issues, in particular over the handling of Cuban refugees.  Now on to convincing South Africa…"
 SAF_USA80.18.d:0 "Havana has informed us in no uncertain terms that they would refuse to pull out of Angola and withdraw their support of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). The overall thrust of the Cuban government’s response was that while peace is desired, they would not negotiate with the government of South Africa and further argued that Cuba and its African allies are currently winning and plan to double down on their efforts in Angola and Namibia. Without Cuba’s willingness to participate in the plan there is no point in continuing to negotiate with other nations since Cuba’s withdrawal from Angola is a cornerstone of the proposed peace plan. Given this was the ultimate end goal of the "Constructive Engagement” policy, this represents the overall strategic failure of the program."
 SAF_USA80.19.d:0 "An interesting proposal arrived from Washington today. Said proposal is that in exchange for Cuban forces withdrawing from Angola, we acknowledge South West Africa’s independence as Namibia. The proposal has already been agreed to by the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba, our agreement is the last step in the process. On one hand the withdrawal of Cuban forces from the region would be a definite benefit to our strategic goals in the region and weaken communist forces in the area substantially. Unfortunately, it would require sacrificing our territorial integrity by granting independence to Namibia which will surely alienate many hardliners in our government and could cost us further political support in the nation. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.20.d:0 "South Africa has agreed to our regional peace initiative involving Angola and Namibia. With Pretoria’s agreement we can now await Cuba’s withdrawal from Angola and subsequently bolster lethal aid to the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to finally turn the tide of communism in southern Africa. Additionally, given lasting regional peace in Namibia was one of the defining strategic goals of the "Constructive Engagement” policy this is a definite victory and vindication for the administration's foreign policy initiatives. Yet work remains, the administration still needs to ensure the stability of South Africa and seek to encourage reforms in said nation as well as ensure the victory of Jonas Savimbi’s UNITA over the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) government. If both of these additional tasks can be completed, this would surely become a major accomplishment of President [USA.GetLeader] which would be remembered for years to come."
 SAF_USA80.21.d:0 "Surprisingly South Africa has rejected our plan for Cuban withdrawal from Angola in exchange for Namibian independence. Pretoria argued that this a blatant attempt to establish regional peace at the expense of the territorial integrity of their nation. [SAF.GetLeader] further argued that the plan would do nothing to prevent the African National Congress (ANC) and South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO) from utilizing Namibia as a base to further attacks inside South Africa. Given that the Soviets and Cubans had already agreed to the measure this will actively damage our African strategic goals and long term plans. Given this was the ultimate end goal of the "Constructive Engagement” policy, this represents the overall strategic failure of the program."
 SAF_USA80.22.d:0 "In a shocking announcement, the governments of the Soviet Union, Cuba, South Africa and the United States have stated their support for the Windhoek Accords, which are set to be signed in the immediate future. The Windhoek Accords are a regional peace plan designed to seek an end to the escalating conflict in the region by South Africa recognizing Namibia’s independence under an interim government led by the SWAPO. In exchange, Cuba will withdraw its military forces in Angola on behalf of the Angolan government. International reaction has been mixed, with most major powers praising the move towards peace, while the Anti-Apartheid movement and Angolan government blasted the agreement as "selling out black South Africans.”"
 SAF_USA80.23.d:0 "In recent weeks, the American government has begun pressuring our government to make political reforms. Given America is our primary major international backer, this is quite the problem. If we accept major reforms there will surely be a domestic backlash by hardliners, especially as tensions with the Nasionale Party are rising and the threat of a schism increases by the day. On the other side, by rejecting the pressure to make reforms there are strong odds that America will cease blocking sanctions against our government at the United Nation elsewhere which would be detrimental to our economy and war effort as well as likely further destabilizing the nation. Another route forward perhaps is to make moderate reforms to try to appease Washignton while also trying to balance the hardliners in parliament, yet this route could easily lead to alienating both Washington and hardliners. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.24.d:0 "Surprisingly, South African President  [SAF.GetLeader) has agreed to begin implementing political reforms. In particular President [SAF.GetLeader] noted his plan to address parliament with a proposal to expand voting rights to some degree and seek discourse within the government and legal opposition for what other reforms could be agreed upon.  While this is a more moderate course than our administration desires, this is still a good start including a public commitment to making public reforms in the near future. Unfortunately, with party leadership chartering a more moderate course will likely further inflame political tensions in South Africa. While we will need to track the progress and possibly provide covert political aid to mitigate any reactionary backlash in the next elections, this is a vindication for the administration's South African policy."
 SAF_USA80.25.d:0 "In an address to parliament earlier, South African President [SAF.GetLeader] gave a blistering address blasting the west for their betrayal of the white race and consequently South Africa. By all accounts so far, it appears our pressure campaign has backfired and has led to Pretoria doubling down on Apartheid and minority rule. Now we must evaluate how to proceed, our choices remaining are to continue the pressure campaign by placing sanctions against South Africa or ignoring the problem and continuing providing covert support to South Africa’s military activities in South West Africa and Angola. Neither of these choices are optimal and will have major costs and risks. The first route forward will run the risk of emboldening the communist government of Angola as well as validate Cuba’s intervention in the region, while the second option will likely lead to international condemnation and domestic political controversy."
 SAF_USA80.26.d:0 "In a surprising speech, South African President [SAF.GetLeader] announced he would be pursuing a course of moderate reforms to expand the political process in the nation to more of the nation's citizenry regardless of racial status. While the details of the proposed reforms were not disclosed, speculation abounds that the primary move will be to reform parliament to either give black citizens the right to vote for specific seats or add a new wing of parliament for each major racial group in the nation. The international reaction has been mixed, Washington and London praised the move as a victory for the "Constructive Engagement” policy, the international Anti-Apartheid movement condemned the move as a token half measure."
 SAF_USA80.27.d:0 "In a recent meeting with President [USA.GetLeader], we were informed that the United States would like for us to begin pressuring the South African government on the issue of Apartheid and minority rule. Given our historical relationship with South Africa our influence with the government in Pretoria could be useful in attempting to pressure the nation to make reforms. That said this is not a simple issue and should be carefully considered before a decision is made. Given the internal divisions in our government over how to approach South Africa, either choice will have domestic political consequences. Another factor to consider is the ongoing wars in Angola and South West Africa that involve South Africa, sanctions may disrupt the broader war effort against the communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and South West People’s Organization (SWAPO) in southern Africa. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA80.28.d:0 "Thankfully, the British government has decided to join our pressure campaign against the South African government. Outside of our own nation, Britain is perhaps the closest major nation with South Africa, given that it is a former dominion of said nation and has a vested interest in South Africa. Hopefully our pressure campaign will lead to positive reforms in South Africa, that said concerns abound that the pressure campaign could backfire and either lead to issues with the Angolan Civil War, South African Border War or emboldening hardliners in both the African National Congress, Nasionale Party and Conservative Party. The British government also implied that if the pressure campaign did not get results they would be willing to discuss with us the coordination of economic sanctions to be placed on South Africa in the coming years. Overall, this is a solid starting point for our new South African policy and launching a pressure campaign against the government in Pretoria."
 SAF_USA80.29.d:0 "Unfortunately, the British government has refused to join our pressure campaign against the South African government. Britain argued that while the policy of Apartheid was distasteful that they did not believe diplomatically pressuring Pretoria would lead to credible results and would only seek to further estrange South Africa among the international community and ultimately delay progress on the issue. An additional argument provided was that by pressuring the nation that hardliners in the nation would only embolden the hardliners in the government and could prevent future reforms made by the government. Overall, this is a definite stumbling block for our new South African policy and launching a pressure campaign without Britain will surely be less effective."
 SAF_USA80.30.d:0 "In recent months the Anti-Apartheid movement has been heavily gaining momentum in the international community. This comes as the United States and United Kingdom have ramped up diplomatic pressure on our government to begin implementing reforms in regard to Apartheid and move towards majority rule. This leaves us with few options, first off we could simply continue to ignore the international community’s complaints about our regimes, given that pressure is now being applied by our traditional allies, this would likely lead to economic sanctions and potential further destabilization which would not be ideal. The second option would be to accept the need for some level of reforms but slow roll the process to give ourselves more time to find alternatives to fully giving up power. Our final option would be simply to make a major move towards majority rule and begin to dismantle Apartheid. That said this option will not be tenable if the influence of hardliners in our government is too high."
 SAF_USA80.31.d:0 "Earlier today we received word from Pretoria that South Africa has accepted our requests and will begin to deliberate some reforms to reduce Apartheid and take measures to give more power to the general populace. While this is a positive development, the actual reforms will need to be evaluated and tracked to make sure they are actual genuine reforms and not conciliatory measures for international consumption while in effect changing nothing internally. Hopefully this will begin a process of reforms in South Africa to gradually empower the majority into the political process and tear down the Apartheid system. The ideal outcome here would be a truly democratic pro-western South Africa that will continue to share our strategic goals in the region and continue to contribute to the fight against communism in Africa and elsewhere."
 SAF_USA80.32.d:0 "Earlier today we received word from Pretoria that South Africa has rejected our calls and pressure campaign to make reforms to begin moving away from Apartheid. While unfortunate, the announcement is not particularly surprising to our administration. The next step in this strategy will now be to evaluate what sanctions will be most effective against the South African ruling class and weigh their efficacy and damage to the general populace and war effort in Namibia and Angola. The aforementioned complication with enacting sanctions on South Africa is that as Pretoria continues to fight against the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO) and continue to support our allies in the Angolan Civil War is that overly punitive sanctions will likely harm our other strategic goals in the region. Overall, the situation in South Africa remains problematic and all of our potential future moves will have major consequences on our other foreign policy strategic goals in the region."
 Anti_Apartheid84.1.d:0 "THE COMPREHENSIVE ANTI-APARTHEID ACT: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA) was first introduced in the early 1970s by Congressman Ron Dellums, while the bill failed to pass there has been building pressure within the Congress to act on the legislation and the Senate has begun debate on the CAAA after overcoming a filibuster attempt by Senate Republicans.\n\nThe legislation would seek to suppress funding to the South African government along with implacing trade and travel sanctions to further disrupt the South African government until it takes measures to begin dismantling Apartheid. In terms of domestic politics, the best course of action would be to allow Congress to vote on the law without pressure, that said if the government desires to continue to engage with South Africa then actively trying to convince enough Senators to block the motion would be ideal. That said, such a measure may have serious political costs."
 Anti_Apartheid84.2.d:0 "Yesterday evening Congress finalized its passage of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act by an overwhelming margin. In addition to this, polling has indicated the public also overwhelmingly supports the legislation along with other measures against South Africa. Now the question is how do we proceed. On one hand signing the act into law would be politically popular but would likely end any potential dialogue with the South African government in the immediate future. Alternatively, the president could issue a veto of the legislation and launch a lobbying campaign to swing enough Senators to vote against a veto override. If we desire to go down this route, the South African government has offered to help in trying to convince senators by having the South African Foreign Minister personally phone potential supporters of a veto to convince them to support the administration’s stance on South Africa. How should we proceed?"
 Anti_Apartheid84.3.d:0 "In a relative surprise, the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA) failed to secure the necessary votes for passage. Assuming the government intends to continue the policy of constructive engagement this is a notable victory for continuing relations with South Africa. That said, public opinion polling has continued to show a growing majority supports the CAAA and further sanctions on South Africa and ending the policy of constructive engagement. Furthermore, supporters of the CAAA have pledged to reintroduce the legislation in the future. Overall, while this push for the CAAA failed, the domestic political push for change in South Africa will in all likelihood continue to escalate and the administration should take note to assure the public of how it plans to deal with the regime in Pretoria."
 Anti_Apartheid84.4.d:0 "In an overwhelming vote, the American Congress ratified the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA). The act would require the administration to sever funding for the South African government along with imposing trade and travel sanctions on South Africa until the nation takes concrete steps to dismantle Apartheid. The international Anti-Apartheid movement has praised the passage of the CAAA while critics of the law have argued that the law represents a gross overreach of Congressional authority into the authority of the Executive Branch in terms of powers over directing foreign policy. The next question is how the administration will react to the passage of the law."
 Anti_Apartheid84.5.d:0 "President [USA.GetLeader] surprised the world by vetting the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, however Congress managed to override the veto and secure the final passage of the legislation. That said, the administration repeatedly decried the law as overreaching into the affairs of the executive branch in terms of dictating foreign policy. While the administration has applied the sanctions noted in the law the American government has still sought to maintain diplomatic relations with Pretoria thus angering the international  Anti-Apartheid movement. Supporters of the CAAA have decried the continued relations with South Africa as violating the spirit of the law while the administration has countered that it is fully following the legislation passed by Congress.."
 SAF_USA84.1.d:0 "SOUTH AFRICAN SANCTIONS: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nWith the growing movement to pressure South Africa to end minority rule, dismantle Apartheid and end its occupation of Namibia it has become increasingly clear our prior practice of trying to constructively engage with South Africa may have been misguided to some extent. Additionally, with Congress seeming to be calling for a tougher stance on South Africa it would be in our best interests to fully implement sanctions against South Africa. Prior efforts to engage with South Africa have shown limited if any measures of success and quite possibly has enabled the government to take a stronger stance internally against certain types of reform. Regardless, the move to place sanctions on South Africa will surely be popular with the general public and international community."
 SAF_USA84.2.d:0 "AFRICAN NATIONAL CONGRESS: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nAs the administration has chartered a course to be supportive of the current South African government with the goal of containing communism in southern Africa, additional measures will need to be taken to enhance this cause. To begin with, we should designate the African National Congress (ANC) and its affiliates as terrorist organizations. This would empower the government to target the financiers and suppliers of the ANC"
 SAF_USA84.3.d:0 "In a contentious press conference earlier today, the [USA.GetLeader] administration announced that they would be designating the African National Congress (ANC) along with its armed wing the uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) as terrorist organizations.The reaction to this announcement has been divisive to say the least. Polling indicates that a large majority of Americans disapprove of the announcement, but does indicate a notable minority supportive of the announcement, mainly in the American South and Mountain West. The international community and Anti-Apartheid movement have voicerfully denounced the announcement and have characterized the move as immoral, racist and unchristian. On the other side, the South African government praised the announcement and also noted their desire for further strengthening of ties with Washington."
 SAF_USA84.4.d:0 "Excellent news from Washington, the United States has formally designated the African National Congress (ANC) and uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK) as terrorist organizations. This designation will empower the United States to investigate domestic backers of the ANC along with suppressing fundraising campaigns and pro-ANC organizations within the United States along with pressuring affiliated nations to block material support from third parties for the ANC. Ideally, this move could also lead to more sympathetic or at least less critical coverage of our cause in western media and could enable us to show the true depravity of our enemies. That said, the reaction to this announcement has been controversial internationally to say the least, and we should keep a close eye on the domestic political situation in the United States."
 SAF_USA84.5.d:0 "Discourse with Washington has been difficult to say the least in regard to making reforms to the Apartheid system and minority rule. A new proposal by the American State Department is to instead of pushing for direct political reforms is to argue instead to loosen economic and social laws under the guise of economic liberalization. While this would not directly impact the political situation of the nation, the removal of economic limitations within the Apartheid system would surely progress towards a more free society in the long run. With that said, the international community and Anti-Apartheid movement will likely not see it this way and argue that it is simply another example of economic imperialism at the expense of black Africans. However, does a rising tide not lift all boats?"
 SAF_USA84.6.d:0 "In response to our economic liberalization proposals for their nation, Pretoria has seemingly accepted the proposal. President [SAF.GetLeader] concurred that this method of reform would be beneficial to the nation and the easiest to sell in parliament to the various factions within it. That said, President [SAF.GetLeader] noted that the fundamentals of the Apartheid system would not be particularly modified in this liberalization push and noted in particular that the Group Areas Act would not be repealed by his government. While this is unfortunate, any moves towards reforms are something we can show to the public as a victory for the "Constructive Engagement” policy and bolster our cause to prevent sanctions on South Africa. Additionally, given the vast mineral resources in South Africa, perhaps our donors will be able to profit off the opening up of the South African economy? While there will surely be pushback from the Anti-Apartheid movement over this move, does a rising tide not lift all boats? Hopefully economic progress in South Africa will lead to a more free society and sideline elements of the Anti-Apartheid movement."
 SAF_USA84.7.d:0 "In response to our economic liberalization proposals for their nation, Pretoria has rejected this proposal. President [SAF.GetLeader] argued that the proposal would greatly erode the Apartheid system and would be a gateway to majority rule. In particular, Pretoria claims that repealing the Group Areas Act would be necessary for our economic reform plans which Pretoria has derided as selling out the white population of South Africa.  Analysts in the State Department also believe that the increased militancy of Afrikaans hardliners in the government are also a contributing factor to the rejection of the proposal. Regardless, this represents a major failure of the "Constructive Engagement” policy of the administration and will surely lead to domestic and international criticism of our South African policy."
 SAF_USA84.8.d:0 "Great news from Washington arrived today. The American ambassador informed our government that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) would actively expand the amount of intelligence shared with our military and intelligence apparatus. This comes after Washington has shifted to a much more favorable course in regard to our nation and struggle against the communist menace in our nation and Angola. In particular, the intelligence sharing will be in regard to Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), South West African People’s Organization (SWAPO) and Cuban forces and positions in Angola and South West Africa to bolster our efforts in the Border War and to further boost UNITA in Angola."
 SAF_USA84.9.d:0 "In a primetime televised address, President [USA.GetLeader] gave an impassioned speech condemning the South African government and Apartheid. The President argued that it was fundamentally immoral and against the founding principles of America along with going against basic decency and religious values to continue support of said regime. The speech has been largely received positively among both domestic and international audiences, supporters of the Anti-Apartheid movement in particular approved of the speech and called for further concrete action to be taken. On the other side of the aisle, certain anti-communist advocacy groups such as the Heritage Foundation blasted the speech as selling out South Africa and our other regional allies to Moscow and Havana."
 SAF_USA88.0.d:0 "THE APARTHEID PROBLEM: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespire our efforts to promote reform within South Africa over the last several years, progress has been slim to say the least in any actual move towards majority rule. With this in mind, we have two core choices, especially with the importance of South Africa in fighting against communism in the region. Our first option is to continue negotiations and seek to continue dialogue with South Africa with the goal of promoting reform within the nation while trying to limit effects on the battlefield. Alternatively, we could simply seek to stop trying to fight against Apartheid and openly collaborate with Pretoria. While this move would be controversial with the general public and international community to put it lightly, this would likely be the most effective in containing communism within the region and could help our efforts in Angola."
 SAF_USA88.1.d:0 "After much deliberation, our government has decided to move away from pushing South Africa to reform or condemning the Apartheid state to outright supporting the nation in exchange for its continued support against communism in Africa and perhaps elsewhere as well. Outside of covertly sabotaging the Anti-Apartheid movement and making diplomatic moves in support of South Africa, we will also need to consider how best to arm the nation in light of its ongoing conflicts as well as how to economically develop and revitalize the state after the damages done to its economy by racial conflict and sanctions.\n\nUnfortunately, the general public has not been supportive of our efforts and has been widely critical of this shift in policy. That said, the damage is done and as long as the economy is good the issue should fade from the public interest. The administration should also consider targeting Anti-Apartheid activists and generating favorable media attention to the plight of white South Africans to try to mitigate the ongoing political consequences of this course of action."
 SAF_USA88.2.d:0 "As time passes the Apartheid regime in South Africa has become more of an international pariah and more difficult to defend at home and abroad. Thankfully the South African government has finally acknowledged this and is now willing to commence covert negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC) about the potential for future publicly acknowledged talks on the subject of reforming the nation. While this is a very early step towards reform and could easily lead to no progress, it is still the potential beginning of the end for Apartheid through a political and diplomatic process. That said, there are various opponents of negotiations and a full reconciliation and reunification of South Africa, many leaders in the "Bantustans” will likely be opposed to rejoining South Africa fully without at least strong guarantees of local autonomy. Additionally, more radical groups on both ends of the spectrum will likely oppose any form of peaceful reconciliation and will pressure their respective sides to walk away from the negotiating table. Providing support for moderate unifying figures on both sides will be critical for future success."
 SAF_USA88.3.d:0 "In a recent meeting with the American ambassador, we were informed that America is now urging us to expand our covert discourse with  the African National Congress into actual negotiations on ending the Apartheid system as well as ending minority rule. Regardless of how we choose to respond there will be major issues. To start with, if we agree to progress with negotiations there will surely be a backlash from the growing Conservative Party (KP) lead by Andries Treurnicht and discontent from other hardliners in government as well as opposition from the leaders of the black homelands. On the other hand, even if we agree to hold negotiations there is no guarantee that we will be able to overcome significant issues, especially regarding regional powers and veto control for minority groups in a new state. On the other hand, negotiations could lead to a relaxation of sanctions which would surely be beneficial to the nation. How should we proceed?"
 SAF_USA88.4.d:0 "President [SAF.GetLeader] of South Africa has responded positively to our request to begin negotiations with the opposition over Apartheid. Given the declining security situation in the region this is hopefully a positive step towards establishing lasting peace and stability in the region. Pretoria noted that the goal of their new negotiation strategy would be to initiate talks with the African National Congress (ANC) about the conditions both sides would need to meet before entering into serious negotiations on the future of the country. While intelligence backs up the claim of the current government having contacts with the ANC the presence of hardliners in both the government and opposition raises concerns over the long term viability of this plan and the potential for mass violence and societal upheaval remains, contingency planning should be continued for if the situation in South Africa deteriorates into civil war. Special attention needs to also be placed on the "Bantustans” and KwaZulu given their apparent dissatisfaction with a reunified unitary South Africa, opposition and tension is likely to come from these entities as well.  Overall, this is a good start to a hopefully end to Apartheid, but many pitfalls, problems and concerns remain ahead."
 SAF_USA88.5.d:0 "Unfortunately South Africa has refused to begin negotiations over Apartheid with our government. Pretoria argued that any changes need to be determined by the South African government free of foreign influence. South Africa also noted the unwillingness for the international community and African National Congress (ANC) to compromise on the status of regional governments, autonomy and the "Banutstans” are a major obstacle to any meaningful negotiations occurring in the near future. The new hardline stance in South Africa comes on the heels of the rise of Andries Treurnicht’s Conservative Party (KP) in polling for the upcoming South African elections the KP broke off of the Nasionale Party over the willingness of the government to engage in reforms and represents a new potential roadblock to further reforms and negotiations."
 SAF_USA88.6.d:0 "Negotiations between the South African government under [SAF.GetLeader] continue to progress and the African National Congress (ANC) are progressing well. Several parties have agreed to establish an organization to discuss reforms in a multiparty setting titled the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA). This is a major step towards lasting peace and reforms yet challenges remain. Radical factions on both sides have refused to participate in CODESA, including the Herstigte Nasionale Party (HNP), Conservative Party (KP), Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and Azanian People's Organisation (AZAPO). Elements of the Inkatha Freedom Party have also boycotted CODESA over the refusal to admit a separate delegation for the Zulu monarch. Besides these boycotts and potential political backlash in the South African government, another contentious issue for the negotiations is that while the parties have agreed upon the reunification of South Africa, how this will be accomplished and what the nature of the reformed state is a highly contentious issue. Time will tell how this plays out, but for now there is hope for a peaceful settlement in South Africa."
 SAF_USA88.7.d:0 "In light of the growing progress in our negotiations with the United States, Washington has announced that they will begin relaxing some of the sanctions placed on our economy. While this is excellent news in terms of dealing with our economic downturn and potentially helping reduce economic tensions, it has inflamed the growing discontent of hardliners in our government opposed to our path of current reforms. Attention will need to be placed on the military and intelligence apparatus to ensure there is no chance of a coup against our government by the hardliners. Fortunately, we should be able to point to the relaxation of sanctions as demonstrating the west’s commitment to holding up their end of the deal and should use this to push for further reforms."
 SAF_USA88.8.d:0 "While negotiations with South Africa have progressed there are still significant obstacles before it would be wise to begin relaxing targeted sanctions on leading South African officials and companies. While detractors and some in the South African government will inevitably argue that this is a violation of the negotiations and stated policy, the State and Treasury Departments have been directed to investigate what broader economic sanctions should be lifted to reduce the economic impact on the general South African populace while maintaining pressure on the South African governing class by continuing the personal sanctions on their being. Ideally, this should keep pressure on the government by keeping them personally sanctioned while also showing the good faith of the United States by relieving some economic sanctions. Overall, negotiations are progressing well with South Africa, but more progress is needed before we should consider relaxing the targeted sanctions in place on notable government officials."
 SAF_USA88.9.d:0 "THE SOUTH AFRICAN WMD PROGRAM: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nOver the last decade various rumors have circulated over a potential South African nuclear program, unfortunately we can confirm the existence of an advanced nuclear program in South Africa with it likely that several bombs are assembled and operational. In addition to this, the South African military has various chemical and biological agents in its arsenal. While we could simply ignore the program, the risks of the usage of any of these agents could easily spell disaster for our efforts in the region. Furthermore, there is evidence pointing to a contingency plan in place to test a nuclear bomb in the case of a potential civil war to ward off foreign interference. With this information established, at the least we should request South Africa dismantle its WMD program."
 SAF_USA88.10.d:0 "The American embassy earlier today relayed a message containing a request that we end our WMD program, with specific emphasis on dismantling our nuclear weapons program. While the program has been kept top secret within our government, unfortunately the Americans are now aware of it. This request leaves us with two rather obvious options, on one hand we could end the program and attempt to leverage this for aid or relaxation of sanctions, but doing so would reduce our contingency options in case of potential civil war. Alternatively, given the international sanctions are already a major problem, we could continue the program, after all the utilization of a nuclear bomb is our ultimate contingency against the continuation of a civil war. Either option has potentially major drawbacks, how should"
 SAF_USA88.11.d:0 "In a communique from Pretoria, the South African government signaled it would end its various WMD programs and would also commence dismantling what nuclear devices were already assembled. That said, the South African government also noted that this deprived them of their main contingency plans in case of a race war and has privately asked for support in the case of full scale civil war along with either intelligence sharing or relaxation of sanctions in exchange for dismantling the nuclear program. Regardless, Pretoria has committed to dismantling its nuclear devices and abandoning its earlier contingency plan thus mitigating the worst case outcome in South Africa that would surely drag the world into the conflict in southern Africa.."
 SAF_USA88.12.d:0 "In a communique from Pretoria, the South African government signaled it would not end its various WMD programs. Pretoria argues that the program is a necessary deterrent against foreign intervention in the case of civil unrest and that the chemical and biological agents were a needed level of defense against the potential of invasion from neighboring powers especially in light of the ongoing border war in Southwest Africa. While perhaps unsurprising, the refusal is a major cause for concern, especially as the potential for civil strife continues to rise due to the continuance of minority rule and Apartheid. To further complicate the situation, various intercepts from Israel implies that Israel is also involved in this sordid affair and has been collaborating with South Africa in terms of nuclear weapon development. Given these factors, it would not be advisable to leak the existence of the nuclear program to the media to further coerce the South African government, for now we must simply hope for the best."
 SAF_USA88.13.d:0 "In our continuous efforts to contain and rollback communism in southern Africa, our primary collaborator remains South Africa. Unfortunately South Africa’s Apartheid policy and continued minority rule detract from our shared anti-communist struggle. With that in mind, one way of sidelining the criticism of minority rule would be to promote self-rule in various parts of South Africa. Within the last decade, South Africa supposedly granted a form of independence to four of these regions. These being the so called Bantustans of Ciskei, Venda, Transkei and Bophuthatswana. That said, no nation outside South Africa has recognized these states as independent. By doing so ourselves we could aim to promote this behavior and coerce over states into recognizing the four states in an aim to further legitimize the South African government. On the downside, doing this will likely alienate many domestically within the nation and will surely be criticized by the Anti-Apartheid movement."
 SAF_USA88.14.d:0 "In a widely condemned press conference today, President [USA.GetLeader] announced that the United States would be recognizing Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei as independent nations. Outside of South Africa, the United States would be the first nation to recognize the so-called "Bantustans”. Pretoria praised the announcement and called on other nations to follow Washington’s example in recognizing the states. Outside of this, the reaction has been widely negative. Anti-Apartheid leader Bishop Desmond Tutu decried the announcement as a betrayal of common decency and humanity. Domestically, legislation has been introduced by Congressman Ron Dellums (D-CA) to overturn the recognition which is rapidly gaining co-sponsors in the House of Representatives. Public opinion polling of the announcement over the weekend has shown the general American public widely disapproves of the recognition. How this will impact the upcoming presidential elections is yet to be seen."
 SAF_USA88.15.d:0 "Given our recent diplomatic shift to a more openly pro-South African stance, now may be the optimal time to seek to relax South African economic sanctions. By pushing to end the sanctions on South Africa we can  further show our commitment to the South African government as well as make the argument that the sanctions were inefficient and causing more harm to the general populace in South Africa than the leadership of the nation to deflect from criticism from domestic opponents. While this would still surely be unpopular with the general American public, the damage has already been done with the prior announcements of support for South Africa and has also been endorsed by various anti-communist advocacy groups such as the Heritage Foundation. Additionally, the relaxation of sanctions should aid in stabilizing South Africa and should boost its economy and military industrial complex."
 SAF_USA88.16.d:0 "Earlier today we received word from Washington that the American government is seeking to relax sanctions against our nation. This comes after the recent shift in American foreign policy away from "Constructive Engagement” towards a more positive outlook on our government in light of our contributions to the anti-communist cause. That said, this relaxation of sanctions should be quite the boon for our economy and could help in reducing the general instability currently plaguing the nation. Overall, the American shift towards open support for us is not only leading to the relaxing of American sanctions but in effect reducing the efficacy of most western sanctions given that Washington is also actively now actively seeking to undermine the global sanction effort along with bolstering our access to foreign capital and material."
 SAF_USA88.17.d:0 "The American Ambassador earlier today informed us that America will be authorizing military sales to us, thus reversing the decisions by the prior administrations blocking weapon sales to us. While the pricing and any potential favorable rates have yet to be determined this is regardless a major step towards firmer relations with the United States and stronger collaboration in our joint efforts to contain communism in southern Africa. In particular, the ability to buy general equipment and materials to resupply and maintain our air force will be a critical advantage for our operations in Angola and Southwest Africa. Hopefully America’s relaxation of sanctions and renewed military sales will start a trend among the western powers to support our government."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.0.d:0 "COLLAPSE IN SOUTH AFRICA: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nDespite our best efforts at stabilizing the situation the situation in South Africa has all but collapsed. With civil war imminent, determining how to proceed is critical. Given our prior ties to the South African government one route of action would be to support the remnants of the former government. While the former government represents the most anti-communist faction in the conflict, the move would be extremely controversial domestically and quite unpopular on the global stage given the reputation of said faction. The second option would be to outreach to the African National Congress seeking assurances of sidelining communists within the movement in exchange for material support. This course of action could also lead to domestic political controversies but would be more palatable to the international community. The last option would be to declare neutrality in the conflict and perhaps seek to establish a safe zone in the nation in the protection of civilian interests.Regardless, the loss of stability and a strong anti-communist power in southern Africa will likely have dire consequences on our efforts to contain communism in the region."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.1.d:0 "In a press release Friday evening, the United States State Department announced that America would be staying out of the growing conflict in South Africa. While denying siding with either major faction in the civil war, the statement condemned Cuban and Soviet involvement in the conflict and called for taking measures to ensure humanitarian aid could be effectively distributed to those displaced by the conflict. The statement also noted that Washington would be supportive of a safe zone for civilians and aid workers and implied that such an action may be upcoming in a future United Nations session. The overall statement put to doubt potential American overt support for the former South African government that Washington had backed for years prior to the ongoing conflict. "
 USA_SAF_Collapse.2.d:0 "While America has declared neutrality in the ongoing South African Civil War, the immense displacement and human suffering caused to the civilian population of South Africa due to the civil war has led to calls for providing humanitarian aid. That said, given the multiple factions and geopolitical interference into the conflict, sending humanitarian aid is not a simple matter. With that said, the proposal from the State Department includes coordinating aid with various allies, notably Israel and the United Kingdom along with various humanitarian organizations in the case the United Nations is incapable of establishing a humanitarian corridor in the war-stricken nation. In addition to this, given the racial nature of the conflict the groundwork for a refugee crisis is clearly present. On one hand, the morally right thing to do perhaps is to allow for the resettlement of refugees within the United States, that said given the general public’s response to settling Cuban refugees earlier in the decade, this may be a politically costly move, on the other hand, denying refugees entry into the United States would reflect poorly upon us internationally."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.3.d:0 "As we begin preparations for intervention into the South African Civil War, several steps must be taken. Besides the obvious issue of coordinating military assets and logistics, the nature of the conflict necessitates sufficiently preparing the general American public for war against the forces of the former government. Fortunately, polling shows the majority of the American public will likely be supportive of military actions in the region, we will still need to prepare the public for the realities of the conflict along with taking measures to sideline attempts by the far-right, especially white nationalist groups either attempting to spread misinformation or potential terrorist attacks against the government or racial minorities within the United States. Given the widespread global opposition to the former South African regime, attempting to build an international coalition in support of intervention should be given high priority. On the downside, given the strong leftist and communist influence in the ANC, we will need to consider strategies to minimize far-left influence in post war South Africa."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.4.d:0 "As we begin preparations for intervention into the South African Civil War, several steps must be taken. Besides the obvious issue of coordinating military assets and logistics, the nature of the conflict necessitates sufficiently preparing the general American public for war against the African National Congress (ANC) forces. Given the broad public opposition, publicizing atrocities against white civilians in South Africa and utilizing propaganda warfare against the ANC and Anti-Apartheid movement will be a necessity. Given most of our traditional allies will be unlikely to side with our intervention outside of perhaps Britain, it will be necessary to also convince the international community of the justness of our cause as well. One proposal to consider would be to contact Israel and our allies in Latin America for military and diplomatic support in the upcoming operation. Regardless, the decision to intervene in South Africa will be a defining moment of this presidency."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.5.d:0 "INTERVENTION IN SOUTH AFRICA: OUTLOOK AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nSouth Africa Desk, Bureau of African Affairs\nSECRET/NOFORN\n\nThe situation in South Africa has continued to deteriorate and the administration has internally signaled its intention to intervene in the conflict. We have three options for intervening into the conflict, first off we have the option of favoring neither side and attempting to establish a safe zone at first and then use this to pressure both sides into a ceasefire with the goal of an eventual diplomatic solution to the ongoing conflict. While this would be the least costly option, it will surely be the most difficult to enact and require the cooperation of both parties in South Africa along with various other foreign powers seeking to influence the region. The second option would be to intervene on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC). The main issue with this route is that the ANC has fairly strong communist and far-left influences and containing this influence will be quite the challenge, along with potential outcry from some of the fringes in American politics. The final option would be to intervene on behalf of the former South African government. While the former government is by far the most compliant to our interests, it would be difficult to justify intervention for the general American public, let alone the international community. How should we proceed?"
 USA_SAF_Collapse.6.d:0 "After much deliberation the administration has signaled its intentions to intervene in South Africa on behalf of the former government. With that said, this will be a rather difficult intervention given our lack of regional allies and the number of hostile countries in proximity to the conflict, we will need to depend on securing a logistical hub in conjunction with South African government forces, likely in the Cape. An additional complication to this is the strong likelihood of Cuban and Eastern Bloc advisors within the ANC forces which drastically raises concerns over potential armed conflict with said nations leading to an international incident. Given Cuba’s intervention in Angola, it is highly likely that Cuban forces may also actively be participating in the fighting in South Africa.\n\nIn terms of political consequences, the overall American public seems likely to be heavily against such an intervention, that said, Congress is unlikely to back this in an open floor vote, so we should seek to work around the War Powers Act as much as possible before having to consult with Congress. Another domestic concern is that the intervention is likely to stoke the anger of black nationalists and could lead to an increase in terrorist activities."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.7.d:0 "Thankfully the American ambassador has relayed the administration's decision to fully intervene in the civil war on behalf of our cause. While we would have preferred support or earlier or better collaboration so as to have prevented this situation in the first place it is still welcome news to our beleaguered populace. In advance of the intervention we should seek to bolster the security of any ports we currently control to facilitate the arrival of American soldiers and material support.\n\nHopefully this will represent a turning point in the civil war and lead to a quick decisive victory for our side. That said there will surely be a cost for American intervention, we will likely be forced to accede to some level of reforms in the post-war environment along with acceding to demands from American economic interests. Hardliners in the administration are concerned over the potential lack of independence we will have post war in a reunified South Africa and should thus be monitored to mitigate the chance of internal unrest."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.8.d:0 "In a blistering press conference earlier today, President [USA.GetLeader] announced that the United States would be intervening in South Africa on behalf of the former government forces. The basis of the intervention is to ensure that the African National Congress (ANC) takes power in South Africa or the more militant factions from genociding the white population in South Africa. The announcement has been met with mass controversy across the international community and the general American populace. Opinion polling is widely against intervention, especially on behalf of the pro-Apartheid forces and the President’s deploying of forces without Congressional approval has also met significant push back from Congress. Of particular note in terms of foreign responses has been Cuba, which has pledged to expand its intervention into South Africa to oppose "Yankee imperialism”."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.9.d:0 "After much deliberation the administration has signaled its intentions to intervene in South Africa on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC). With that said, this will be a rather difficult intervention given our lack of regional allies and the number of hostile countries in proximity to the conflict.

Another domestic concern is that the intervention is likely to stoke the anger of white supremacists and could lead to an increase in terrorist activities."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.10.d:0 "Surprising news from Washington, the American government has informed us that they would be intervening in South Africa on our behalf. This will in all likelihood represent a decisive turning point in the civil war. Without western support the forces of the former government should easily be outmanned and outgunned, additionally American mediation should make it easier to reign in the rogue "Bantustans” who have maintained their independence so far in the conflict.\n\nWhile the bulk of our membership is pleased with this news, hardliners in leadership are concerned with what cooperation with Washington will entail, especially post war. Relatedly, rumors abound that our Cuban allies may begin withdrawing since they have been made aware of the news. Finally, we should also consider what this intervention will mean for post-war South Africa and how this will impact our leadership in the coming years."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.11.d:0 "In a televised address earlier today, President [USA.GetLeader] announced that America would be intervening in the South African Civil War on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC). President [USA.GetLeader] argued that that intervention was the morally correct thing to do and that America should seek to establish a multiracial democracy in South Africa. The announced intervention has gone over well with the American public with a solid majority approving of the action and the international Anti-Apartheid movement praised the decision as a needed measure to mitigate the bloodshed in South Africa. In other reactions the pro-Apartheid forces slammed the announcement as a betrayal of the white race."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.12.d:0 "After careful consideration, the administration has decided the best way forward in South Africa would be to try to establish a humanitarian safe zone in the nation as a first step towards a diplomatic solution to the ongoing civil war. With that said, there will be difficulties with this strategic choice. We will need to actively negotiate with both major factions in the conflict to get an agreement to honor the safe zone to mitigate the chances of further entanglement to start with. Without buy-in from both sides it will not be possible to establish a humanitarian corridor in the country.\n\nAnother major challenge to this endeavor will be the other nations entangled in the civil war. Given the large Soviet and Cuban support for the African National Congress (ANC), South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) and the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) we will also need to ensure that we do not spark an international incident by engaging with their forces participating in the conflict. Ideally once the safe zone is established we can engage in further dialogue with all factions and seek to bring a diplomatic end to the current conflict."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.13.d:0 "Earlier today we received communications from American diplomats concerning a potential humanitarian safe zone to be established within the nation. On one hand establishing a safe zone and humanitarian corridor would surely help lower the death toll and reduce the longer term damage of the civil war but would distract from our war effort and could complicate our planned upcoming offensives. Furthermore, more militant members within our cause have spoken up against the proposal, decrying it as an imperialist plot to strengthen the pro-government forces or force a negotiated settlement to the conflict. Further complicating this is the presence of Cuban and Soviet advisors within our forces which may not be keen on cooperation with the Americans. How should we proceed?"
 USA_SAF_Collapse.14.d:0 "In a positive development, the African National Congress (ANC) has approved of our call for a humanitarian safe zone to be established in South Africa.

With that said, there are still concerns over how well the safe zone would be addressed by more militant factions within the ANC. Intelligence has shown that various members of the ANC were opposed to the safe zone on the grounds it could be utilized by the opposition to seek additional arms or block routes of advance. Hopefully this will be remembered as a turning point in the conflict towards civility and towards a lasting peace."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.15.d:0 "Unfortunately, the African National Congress (ANC) has replied to our request for establishing a safe zone negatively. The ANC stated that this was simply a mechanism to slow their progress and give time for the former government forces to rearm and regain the strategic initiative. Without agreement from the major factions in the ongoing civil war it will not be possible to establish a safe zone in the region without actively engaging further into the conflict which would assuredly be unpopular with the general public and have issues passing the current Congress. With that said, we should still consider escalating humanitarian aid shipments to the conflict zone and addressing the refugee crisis."

 USA_SAF_Collapse.18.d:0 "Unfortunately, South Africa has replied to our request for establishing a safe zone negatively. The former government stated that this was simply a mechanism to slow their progress and give time for the former government forces to rearm and regain the strategic initiative. Without agreement from the major factions in the ongoing civil war it will not be possible to establish a safe zone in the region without actively engaging further into the conflict which would assuredly be unpopular with the general public and have issues passing the current Congress. With that said, we should still consider escalating humanitarian aid shipments to the conflict zone and addressing the refugee crisis."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.19.d:0 "In a televised address, American President [USA.GetLeader] announced that the United States will be establishing a safe zone in South Africa in light of the ongoing civil war in the nation with the goal of eventually negotiating a ceasefire. This comes after lengthy negotiations sessions with the African National Congress and opposing government forces. Of note, there has not been serious negotiations between the various minor factions in the war and the United States which has raised concerns from the international community, Washington responded to these concerns by arguing that the various other factions largely are focused on preserving their territory and not in offensive actions and can thus be dealt with at a later date."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.20.d:0 "In a shocking United Nations session in New York earlier today, the American proposal for establishing a safe zone in South Africa amidst the nation’s civil war was defeated in the chamber after receiving a veto from pro-African National Congress (ANC) nations. Critics of the proposal argued that the measure would have led to hampering the armed wing of the AND, the uMkhonto we Sizwe from advancing against its various enemies. Further complicating the measure was the ambiguity over how the safe zone would deal with the minor factions in the conflict, especially in regard to the bantustans that have maintained they are sovereign independent states along with the recently declared state of KwaZulu. While not directly supportive of the former government, the self-declared regional states have clearly positioned themselves in opposition to the ANC for various reasons, much to the displeasure of the ANC and their geopolitical supporters."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.21.d:0 "In a televised primetime address by the President earlier today, the government] announced a ceasefire in South Africa agreed to by all notable factions in the current conflict. This comes after months of strenuous diplomatic and humanitarian measures by our government  including the establishment of a humanitarian corridor and safe zone in the beleaguered nation. While there will surely be difficulties in negotiating a true end to the conflit, this is a major step towards peace and vindication of President [USA.GetLeader]’s South African policies which had come under significant fire from both sides of the aisle for being overly cautious with the conflict.\n\nOpinion polling has signaled a major increase in approval for the current administration in light of the ceasefire announcement. If this leads to a negotiated peace settlement this will surely be a historic moment in securing the President’s long term legacy. This said, there are still major problems to deal with in the region, especially dealing with the involvement of Soviet and Cuban forces along with how to handle the various minor sides in the conflict and finding a suitable resolution for both the African National Congress and former government."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.22.d:0 "In a televised primetime address, President [USA.GetLeader] announced the end of the South African Civil War and successful conclusion of the American intervention in the conflict. While the victory of our forces will always be a noted accomplishment for our administration, what comes next will be just as important. Now it comes for us to determine who should be leading the interim government and hold negotiations between the various parties to ensure that this leads to a lasting peace in the region. With the victory of the African National Congress (ANC) we will need to ensure that the moderate faction within the ANC comes out triumphant while also looking for moderate white figures in the former ruling class who will be open to working with the ANC. Additionally, negotiations will also need to occur with the various regional powers such as the former Bantustans and the KwaZulu."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.23.d:0 "In a televised primetime address, President [USA.GetLeader] announced the end of the South African Civil War and successful conclusion of the American intervention in the conflict. While the victory of our forces will always be a noted accomplishment for our administration, what comes next will be just as important. Now it comes for us to determine who should be leading the interim government and hold negotiations between the various parties to ensure that this leads to a lasting peace in the region. With the victory of the former government and allied militias we should aim to minimize international backlash by looking for moderate figures within the Nasionale Party and other opposition parties willing to work with the new government. Additionally, negotiations will also need to occur with the various regional powers such as the former Bantustans and the KwaZulu."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.24.d:0 "With a ceasefire in place in South Africa and our troops keeping the peace in the beleaguered nation, we must now determine how we will proceed from here. Given neither side has managed to gain the upperhand in the conflict our options are rather limited. Perhaps the "simplest” option is to break up South Africa among the current lines of control and ethnic groups resulting in several independent states. This would surely require additional peacekeeping resources in the years to come to keep the peace but would likely require the least amount of work in the short term. Our second option would be to establish a coalition interim government to further decide what a reunified South Africa will look like. That said, given the hostilities that have developed since the civil war, this option will be quite difficult and runs the risk of simply restarting the civil war in the years to come."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.25.d:0 "With our intervention on behalf of the African National Congress (ANC) coming to a successful completion it is time for us to determine the future of South Africa. Now per the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency we have two primary options. Our first option is to establish an interim government under moderate, multi-racial coalition figures not overly tied to the civil war. The second option is to in effect federalize with strong regional autonomy on ethnic grounds by empowering and expanding the "Bantustans”, guaranteeing a KwaZulu homeland as well as a homeland for white South Africans in the cape. Both of these choices will likely be controversial and cause tensions in South Africa among both the coalition members and the remaining Afrikaan armed forces. By establishing strong regional autonomy and ensuring basic rights to all South Africans under a multiracial leadership ideally we can establish a lasting peace in South Africa."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.26.d:0 "With our intervention on behalf of the former government coming to a successful completion it is time for us to determine the future of South Africa. Now per the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency we have two primary options. Our first option is to establish an interim government under a former government figure not directly tied to the civil war. The second option is to in effect balkanize the nation on ethnic grounds by empowering and expanding the "Bantustans” and guaranteeing KwaZulu independence. For the first option, government analysts have also noted that we will need to ensure a new constitution is adopted to mark a shift away from the controversial past and seek a more moderate course in the future without alienating Afrikaan hardliners desiring a Volkstaat. Both of these options will still require dealing with the remnants of the African National Congress forces along with the other leftist militias still fighting against the government."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.27.d:0 "Attempting to build an interim government for South Africa in light of the ceasefire is a steep challenge to say the least. Given that prominent figures from either the Nasionale Party or African National Congress are likely to be unpalatable to the opposing sides we will need to look at the more moderate and regionalist factions to find leaders. Analysts in the State Department and Central Intelligence Agencies have finalized a plan for Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party to assume the presidency while Zach de Beer, the leader of the Democratic Party and former leader of the Progressive Federal Party as prime minister. While we will allow other posts to be agreed upon by these two, our administration believes the defense ministry must go to a prominent figure in the previous armed forces to ensure continuity and professionalism. Our analysts have settled upon former general Constand Viljoen, while a controversial figure, he should be able to reign in the Afrikaner militias seeking an independent Volkstaat. While by no means the most stable coalition may be our best bet to establish a functional South Africa in light of the last several years."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.28.d:0 "Well given both major sides in the civil war have failed to gain the upperhand and the United States with an international coalition has forced an end to the fighting here we are. Washington has decided that neither side in the conflict can be trusted to wield power in a post-war South Africa. We have been informed that the new government will be helmed by Mangosuthu Buthelezi leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party as President, Zach de Beers of the Democratic Party as Prime Minister and retired general Constand Viljoen as defense minister. The goal of this group is to appease the major factions in the nation that Washington sees as pro-western or potentially politically reliable. Unfortunately this will result in the political sidelining of both major parties heading the war and will likely lead to both sides' forces being forcibly disarmed in the near future."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.29.d:0 "During a press conference in Pretoria earlier today, the new interim government of South Africa was announced. The core of the new government, President Mangosuthu Buthelezi leader of the KwaZulu Inkatha Freedom Party, Prime Minister Zach de Beer leader of the Democratic Party and Defense Minister retired general Constand Viljoen is a rather ideologically diverse group to say the least. The eclectic group has no representatives from either the African National Congress or the former ruling Nasionale Party which has led to condemnations from both ends of the political spectrum. The international community has largely praised the move as placing a diverse set of committed leaders for a united democratic South Africa that will work towards reforming the state and establishing a lasting peace in the troubled nation."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.30.d:0 "Our backing of the African National Congress (ANC) during the South African Civil War has paid dividends for our foreign policy objectives. Now with a ceasefire in place and the disarming of former government forces occurring we can work towards establishing an interim government. There are a variety of Anti-American factions in the Tripartite Alliance, especially within the South African Communist Party (SACP) and Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). Over the course of the conflict, the Central Intelligence Agency has actively sought to discredit and sideline prominent members of the COSATU and SACP along with overly leftist members of the ANC. Our final major problem is that of Nelson Mandela himself, the State Department’s solution is to put moderate Mangosuthu Buthelezi as prime minister while having Nelson Mandela as a president with limited powers. Ideally this will eventually lead to a democratic multiparty South Africa and the dissolution of the Tripartite Alliance between the ANC, COSATU and SACP."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.31.d:0 "As the war has come to a conclusion and the general disarmament of the opposition has begun, we need to stabilize the situation further by establishing a new interim government in the lead up to elections under a new constitution. Given the length, controversy and bloodshed from the civil war, the best option to head the new interim government will most likely be someone not overly active during the civil war or tied to any of the leftist factions of the Tripartite Alliance. During the course of American intervention we have been compelled to compromise with certain regionalist parties, in particular the Inkatha Freedom Party. With the readmission of Mangosuthu Buthelezi into the ANC it is highly likely that the United States will ensure a high place in the government for him while aiming to sideline Nelson Mandela into a ceremonial presidential role. While overall unfortunate, the American intervention surely was a decisive turning point in our victory over the government and led to the end of Apartheid, the loss of direct control over the interim government is a major loss, but ultimately a minor cost in comparison to finally accomplishing the end of Apartheid."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.32.d:0 "With the South African Civil War being decisively won by the African National Congress (ANC) forces after the American intervention After weeks of negotiations it has been reported that Nelson Mandela would become president of the new South African government while Mangosuthu Buthelezi will become the prime minister. In the new constitution recently ratified the President is largely a ceremonial figurehead while the bulk of the power is held by the prime minister. This has largely alienated more militant members of the ANC who have criticized the apparent sidelining of Mandela and have threatened to cause a schism within the party, that said many are just relieved that the fighting has ended and wish for a return to stability."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.33.d:0 "As the war has come to a conclusion and the general disarmament of the opposition has begun, we need to stabilize the situation further by establishing a new interim government in the lead up to new elections under a revised constitution. Given the length, controversy and bloodshed from the civil war, the best option to head the new interim government will most likely be someone not in the government for the last several years or tied to any of the pro-government factions in the civil war. Representatives from the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency have agreed that Chris Heuins would be an ideal and willing head of the interim government. Heunis was the former minister for the environment, home affairs, transport and constitutional development during the course of the 1980s and left politics prior to the onset of civil war making him an ideal candidate, especially given his credentials as a reformer. While we will leave more specific elements of the government to Heunis and other allies, looking for partners in the Inkatha Freedom Party, Coloured and Indian parties such as the United Democratic Party and Solidarity Party will likely find potential pro western moderates who could be useful in the new government. Intelligence particularly favors giving significant posts to Jac Rabie, leader of the United Democratic Party and Jayaram Narainsamy Reddy the head of the Solidarity Party to help reduce racial tensions."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.34.d:0 "Given the American intervention in our civil war leading to the victory of our forces, our future government will be decided not in Pretoria but in Washington. The terms laid out so far is that the new South Africa will be a federal state with heavy autonomy for the Bantustans and KwaZulu at the minimum along with ensuring at least some level of political participation for all races in the national parliament. The new President that Washington has decided on will be Chris Heuins, the former minister for the environment, home affairs, transport and constitutional development during the course of the 1980s. Heunis had retired from politics and was not affiliated with the government's actions in the imminent lead up to the civil war or actions taken during the war, this combined with his role as the architect of prior reform proposals has led to Washington viewing him as the ideal candidate for the position. Additionally, while the specific roles are yet to be determined, moderates from other races will be guaranteed a number of roles within the interim government, these would include Jayaram Narainsamy Reddy, the leader of the Solidarity Party and Jac Rabie, former leader of the United Democratic Party. Overall, while we have managed to win the war, we will be forced to take a more moderate role and at the least abolish the majority of Apartheid legislation directly tied to economic matters."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.35.d:0 "In an interesting development, the United States has announced the formation of an interim government in South Africa in the aftermath of their intervention on behalf of the former government. The new government will be headed by Chris Heunis, the new president of South Africa and former minister for the environment, home affairs, transport and constitutional development during the course of the 1980s..Heunis a noted architect of reforms in the prior decade is an unexpected choice for leadership given his retirement from politics in the late 1980s prior to the war. The new government also includes representation from the moderate opposition, coloured population and representation from the so-called Bantustan states which will be reformed in a new federal structure."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.36.d:0 "With the success of our safe zone proposal and in brokering a ceasefire it has become abundantly clear that reconciliation between the various sides of the conflict will not be adequately addressed in any semblance of a timely manner. With this issue, the State Department has decided the best solution to this problem is to break up South Africa along the various lines of control and ethnic borders of the various participants of the conflict. After heated negotiations with the various factions, the general outline will be that the former government will receive the Cape, the various former major Bantustans and KwaZulu will receive full independence with security guarantees and the African National Congress will be granted the rest of former South Africa. All participants in the conflict also agreed to withdraw their forces from Namibia and recognize said country’s independence and full sovereignty. That said, given the high tensions between the various states, it may be in the best interests of the international community to station peacekeepers on the borders to mitigate potential border skirmishes and future conflict points."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.37.d:0 "Since the declaration of the ceasefire in South Africa, it has been unclear what a potential post war South Africa would look like. After weeks of constant painful negotiations, the United States along with representatives from the various sides of the conflict announced what is in effect the end of a unified South Africa. The territory formerly comprising South Africa will be split several ways, with Namibia, KwaZulu, Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei receiving full independence and adjustments to their borders to form more contiguous territories. In addition to this the cape would receive independence, being governed by the remnants of the former government until new elections would be held while the remaining territory would be ceded to the African National Congress. Overall, the war in South Africa has ended, resulting in the end of South Africa itself."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.38.d:0 "With the success of our intervention and the recent  brokering of a ceasefire it has become abundantly clear that reconciliation between the various sides of the conflict will not be adequately addressed in any semblance of a timely manner. With this issue, the State Department has decided the best solution to this problem is to heavily reform South Africa along the various lines of control and ethnic borders of the various participants of the conflict. After heated negotiations with the various factions, the general outline will be that the ANC will be the main governing party of the nation, the various former major Bantustans and KwaZulu will receive heavy autonomy along with establishing a federal governing structure. All participants in the conflict also agreed to withdraw their forces from Namibia and recognize said country’s independence and full sovereignty. On a separate note, we privately should advocate for moderate leadership with the ANC and delegating more leftist members to figurehead positions or seeking their retirement."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.39.d:0 "Since the declaration of the ceasefire in South Africa following major gains by the African National Congress (ANC), it has been unclear what a potential post war South Africa would look like. The United States along with representatives from the various sides of the conflict announced what is in effect the end of a fully unified South Africa. First off, Namibia will receive full independence and KwaZulu will be reintegrated into South Africa, Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei would become part of South Africa but will be given extensive autonomy prior to a referendum to determine their future. Overall, the ANC will largely be in control of the overall nation, but with political infighting among the pro-American and leftist factions within the ANC the future of the nation is uncertain."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.40.d:0 "With the success of our intervention and the recent  brokering of a ceasefire it has become abundantly clear that reconciliation between the various sides of the conflict will not be adequately addressed in any semblance of a timely manner.

After heated negotiations with the various factions, the general outline will be that the former government will receive the bulk of the country, the various former major Bantustans and KwaZulu will receive heavy autonomy and the African National Congress will be granted legal status in the new reconstituted South Africa but will be demilitarized. All participants in the conflict also agreed to withdraw their forces from Namibia and recognize said country’s independence and full sovereignty. That said, given the high tensions between the various states, it may be in the best interests of the international community to station peacekeepers in the beleaguered nation to oversee the process of disarming the ANC and various militias along with ensuring all parties hold up to the agreement."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.41.d:0 "Since the declaration of the ceasefire in South Africa following major gains by the former government, it has been unclear what a potential post war South Africa would look like. AThe United States along with representatives from the various sides of the conflict announced what is in effect the end of a unified South Africa. The territory formerly comprising South Africa will be split several ways, with Namibia receiving full independence, while KwaZulu, Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, and Ciskei would become formally part of South Africa but would be given extensive autonomy. In addition to this the new South Africa will have a federal structure utilizing the former tricameral legislative system designed in the prior decade. Opponents argue that this has simply restored the old government structure under a new coat of paint."
 USA_SAF_Collapse.42.d:0 "Unfortunately, our intervention into the South African Civil War did not go as planned, while initially our forces were able to bolster our allies' position, internal divisions, supply issues and political concerns led to various setbacks for our coalition in South Africa. With the withdrawal of American forces the likelihood of reprisals against our former allies is quite likely. In the coming months we will likely need to determine how to handle the potential refugee crisis stemming from reprisals. In addition to this embarrassing defeat geopolitically, the domestic political consequences of the failure will be extreme. The approval rating of the administration has continually tanked during the conflict and rumblings of a push for impeachment over the mishandling of the war have been increasing. Overall, the loss in South Africa will unfortunately be a defining moment of this administration and very well may represent a low point in America’s global standing in the post war era."
