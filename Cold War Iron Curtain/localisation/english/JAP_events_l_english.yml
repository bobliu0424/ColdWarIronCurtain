 jap_heaven_dissolution_event_description: "Ichiro Hatoyama, the when he was nominated as the Prime Minister last month, had strategically garnered support from both the right and left wings of Shakai-to due to his party, Minshu-to, not having the majority in the House of Representatives. In return for this collaboration, Hatoyama promised the socialist parties an early dissolution of the Diet.\n\nToday, during the plenary session of the House of Representatives, a representative question on the government's three speeches led to an unforeseen development. Hatoyama, along with Hisato Ichimada, the Minister of Finance, responded to questions from Shakai-to member Masamichi Cho. Following this, Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tanzan Ishibashi, took the podium for his question-answer session.\n\nHowever, the proceedings took an unexpected turn when House Speaker To Matsunaga abruptly interrupted Ishibashi, urgently calling out, "Ishibashi Tanzan-kun, Ishibashi Tanzan-kun..." After creating a moment of suspense, Matsunaga continued, "Minister Ishibashi, please wait for a moment." The anticipation of the Minshu-to members and the socialist parties reached its peak when Matsunaga announced, "I have just been informed that the Prime Minister has issued an imperial rescript, which I will now read out loud." Matsunaga proceeded to read the imperial rescript aloud, stating, "In accordance with Article 7 of the Constitution of Japan, the House of Representatives is dissolved." In an unprecedented response, the House of Representatives erupted into applause, and the members shouted "Banzai! Banzai!" celebrating the long-awaited dissolution.\n\nWhen questioned by a newspaper reporter later about the timing of the dissolution, Hatoyama responded in a nonchalant manner, saying, "Because I heard a voice from the heavens.""

 jap_genelec_a.1.d:0 "The government has declared the upcoming 25th General Elections, marking a historic moment as the nation gears up for its first electoral exercise after the lifting of Allied Occupation, as well as under the newly enacted Public Offices Election Law. Enacted in 1950, this law serves as a pivotal consolidation of the former House of Representatives Election Law and House of Councillors Election Law. Its implementation introduces a comprehensive system for the public election of local government leaders and education commissioners.\n\nOne of the significant developments leading up to this electoral milestone is the lifting of the bans on certain public office members, a result of the enforcement of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. This monumental change has opened the political arena to a cadre of experienced politicians who were previously barred from seeking public office. In the aftermath of this policy shift, a substantial number of these individuals have chosen to run for office, marking their return to the forefront of national politics."

Shigeru Yoshida, the influential Honryu Conservative and advocate for pro-American policies, remains at the helm as the Prime Minister, extending his tenure in the face of a resounding mandate. The House of Representatives reflects the magnitude of Jiyu-to's triumph, as they secure a staggering 240 seats. The opposition parties trail behind, with Kaishin-to securing 85 seats, Shakai-to Uha with 57 seats, and Shakai-to Saha closely behind with 54 seats. Kono-to manages to secure a modest 4 seats, while the remaining 26 seats are distributed among various small parties and independent lawmakers. Appalling the far-left activists and communists, the Kyosan-to did not win a single seat in this election, mostly due to decreased public support as a result of their recent militant activities.\n\nAs the dust settles on the election results, Japan braces itself for a period of continued leadership under Shigeru Yoshida and the Jiyu-to party."

Unlike previous cycles, the political spectrum has undergone a big transformation, leading to a more bipolarized National Diet.\n\nAt the forefront of this political realignment are two dominant factions. On one side is the conservative stronghold of Jimin-to, a formidable political party that consolidated its power - through the strategic merger of the once-divided Honryu and Boryu conservative factions - three years ago. On the other side is the socialist Shakai-to; the socialist camp has achieved unity through the merger of left-wing and right-wing factions in 1955.

The Kyosan-to, in a distant third, manages to secure a mere one seat. Independent candidates manage to claim the remaining thirteen seats.\n\nThis electoral outcome marks a noteworthy trend in Japanese politics throughout the 1950s, as conservative candidates consistently dominate the electoral arena.

This treaty serves to officially end Japan's position as an imperial power, to allocate compensation to Allied civilians and former prisoners of war who had suffered Japanese war crimes during World War II, and to end the American-led Allied post-war occupation of Japan and return sovereignty. This treaty made extensive use of the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to enunciate the Allies' goals. From the start of the conference the Soviet Union expressed vigorous and vocal opposition to the draft treaty text prepared by the United States. This treaty also introduced the problem of the legal status of Taiwan due to its lack of specificity as to what country Taiwan was to be surrendered, and hence some supporters of Taiwan independence argue that sovereignty of Taiwan is still undetermined. Moreover, Japan accepted the judgments of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and of other Allied War Crimes Courts according to Article 11.\nThough, the signed treaty is yet to be enforced, this day means big for Japan and its people, for the nation will be finally free from the occupation."

The echoes of the atomic bombings that marked the Empire of Japan's downfall in 1945 still resonate, casting a somber shadow over the nation.\n\nUnder the grasp of the American boot, we have undergone a radical transformation. The year 1947 saw the birth of a new era as the American-influenced constitution took root, birthing a fledgling democracy. Our sacred soil, once guarded by the samurai spirit, now bears the seeds of constitutional principles, most notably in the pacifist embrace of Article 9 that dismantled the once-mighty military machine.\n\nHowever, the winds of change bring not only renewal but also a tempest of challenges. Hyperinflation grips the economy, food shortages persist, and the industrial heartbeat of the nation struggles to recover. Political turbulence, fueled by far-left activists, threatens the fragile stability that remains. Our nation, though downcast, stand resilient.\n\nYet, within the heart of adversity lies our spirit of Yamato. We as a nation with the history of persevering through trials and tribulations, have an undying determination to transcend the hardships. In the hushed whispers beneath the cherry blossoms, there lies a promise that the Land of the Rising Sun will ascend once more.

 japan.1.d:0 "In the wake of the post-occupation era, Japan's evolving stance on Article 9 of its Constitution paved the way for enhanced military capabilities. The Cold War climate further compelled Japan to recognise the imperative of self-defense capabilities in global affairs. Backed by U.S. support, this culminated in the establishment of a Defense Agency and the conversion of the National Security Force into the 'Japan Self-Defense Forces' – a military in all but nomenclature. However, its role is strictly limited to self-defense purposes while closely monitored by the US. The JSDF, comprising the JGSDF, JASDF, and JMSDF, emerges as a response to the geopolitical situation, ensuring Japan's preparedness for self-defense while navigating the delicate nuances of its constitutional framework.

Under this postwar local government system, the roles of municipalities were enhanced and they were charged with the responsibility of operating junior high schools, carrying out fire prevention activities, and dealing with social welfare matters. With the steadily growing population, and thus, growing number of junior highschoolers, as well as the junior high school system being newly-introduced, running them is bound to burden each individual municipality.\nFor this purpose, the Great Showa Consolidation will be underpinned by two municipal merger laws in order to make running the junior highschools effective as well as polish the municipal administration.

 japan.4.d:0 "With the recent introduction of the 'Truman Doctrine', the United States had announced its unyielding stance against communism, with Japan as a target to cleanse it from far-leftist radicals. Last year, with the US diplomat, George Kennan, pressuring MacArthur to change his moderate policy, unrest spilled out between spring and summer as a series of demonstrations by laborers, students and teachers, were held across the major cities of Japan. Unsurprisingly, after approval from Washington, the occupation authorities along with the Eighth Army aggressively suppressed these movements. The infamous "Hanshin Education Incident" occured in April when the Japanese authorities under the directions of the US government and the Japanese Ministry of Education closed down private Korean ethnic schools operating in Japan; it is said such actions were prompted by the fears of possible communist infiltration in the schools. Furthermore, later in September, then-Prime Minister of Japan and a left-leaning politician, Hitoshi Ashida, was arrested along with some of his cabinet officials over the infamous 'Showa Denko Scandal'.\nWith the fresh legacy of last year's events, economic uncertainity, Kyosan-to's political endeavors and the formation of the Zengakuren, far-leftism is only bound to spread across the nation if left unchecked; thus, the situation neccessitates the continuation of slamming the red menace."

 japan.5.d:0 "As the part of the ongoing 'Red Purge' to curb the growing communist threat in Japan, the GHQ's Civil and Information and Education Section has made plans to ensure the education system stays pure from any far-left ideals. For this purpose, the authorities dispatched Dr. Walter C. Eells, who serves at the GHQ as an advisor on higher education, to thirty national universities to call for immediate dismissal of communist-sympathising professors and staff. Eells also visited Niigata University and labelled communism as "dangerous and destructive doctrine". Due to his ideals, anti-communism is slowly becoming a nationwide sentiment and openly shunned by the national newspapers. Plus, there have been noticeable dismissals of far-left sympathisers from educational institutes, mostly over irrelevant reasons. This endeavour is commonly known as the 'Eells Typhoon', or 'Izuru Senpu', as we call it.\n\nSome people argue that Eells's actions are a blatant suppression of academic freedom in Japan, while some would defend him, claiming that the CIE was never directly involved in the red purge. Either way one thing remains clear, that the 'Izuru Senpu' is a critical element in the ongoing red purge."

Additionally, in some parts of the body, internal bleeding was found, which could have been caused only by considerable force, such as kicking. On the other hand, it is also believed that Shimoyama's death was suicide. However, the internal bleeding observed was also consistent with being hit by a train, and investigators would not have been able to observe blood at the scene because it was raining.\n\nA few days prior to his death, Shimoyama was ordered for personnel cutbacks of JNR under the Dodge Line policy and released a list of 30,000 employees to be fired. It is rumoured that he recieved death threats from the high level US military officials to make sure he goes through with the order, which could have caused severe mental distress and hence, possible suicide. On the other hand, there are even rumours that some of the listed employees to be fired could be involved one way or another. Nonetheless, the incident remains a mystery."

However, the final trial and the court ruling on the matter is yet to happen.\n\nThis incident occured not too long after the recent Shimoyama Incident, where the first JNR president, Sadanori Shimoyama, was found dead on the Joban line, and people have already begun to question the authenticity of finger-pointing at the Japan National Railway Union (Kokuro) and the Kyosan-to over these two incidents."

Investigators discovered that the bolts and nuts on the track joints had been loosened, and a large number of railroad spikes fixing the rails to the sleepers had been removed, along with a spanner and pry bar in a nearby rice paddy. As usual, suspicion immediately fell on the Kokuro, workers at the nearby Toshiba-Matsukawa factory and the Kyosan-to workers, due to recent protests over staff cuts. Ten workers from the Matsukawa plant and ten JNR employees were indicted and charged with sabotage.\n\nThe fact that this, along with the recent Shimoyama and Mitaka incidents happened within the span of two months, a conspiracy theory has sprouted that the GHQ with the help of the US intelligence perpetrated the incidents as a pretext to arrest the members of Kokuro and Kyosan-to to thwart any possible far-leftist activism."

Carriers and helicopters form the backbone of any effective naval force, enabling swift deployment of personnel, supplies, and equipment over vast maritime territories.\n\nHowever, it is important to acknowledge that implementing this proposal may attract mild political backlash as the opposition believes that doing so will violate the pacifist constitution and would contribute to an unnecessary arms race."

In addition, the national and local police and the local police were on an equal footing, and the responsibility for national security became unclear.

Nevertheless, the members of the Shakai-to Uha party, interpreting Yoshida's comment as a blatant display of disrespect toward the esteemed institution of the Diet, collectively resolved to refer the Prime Minister to the disciplinary committee for what they deemed a 'disciplinary offense as a lawmaker'. They have also submitted a no-confidence motion, with the voting scheduled to take place soon.

The electoral landscape unfolds with Jiyu-to (199 seats) leading the charge, followed by Kaishin-to (76 seats), Shakai-to Saha (72 seats), Shakai-to Uha (66 seats), the Hatoyama-led Jiyu-to splinter (35 seats), Kono-to (5 seats), and Kyosan-to securing a mere 1 seat. The remaining 11 seats are dispersed among various minor parties and independent candidates.\n\nThis election also marks the first instance where the National People's Examination of Supreme Court Judges was omitted.

Takeo Muto, a former coal worker, emerged as the first chairman, while Zengoro Shimagami, a former Sodomei trader, secured the position of secretary-general. Participation in the event extended beyond the confines of Sohyo-constituent councils, with the inclusion of other civil unions such as Sodomei, Nikkyoso, Kokuro, Tororen, Kaiin, and Shitetsuroren.\n\nThe establishment of Sohyo was significantly influenced by the Allied Occupation GHQ, playing a pivotal role in guiding the union's trajectory. During the founding congress, a declaration was adopted under GHQ guidance, explicitly excluding Kyosan-to ideals. Additionally, there was an emphasis on fostering warm relations with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. Cleansing labour unions of political parties' influence and concentrating on labour economic struggles were also among the key elements of the agenda. Now, Sohyo emerges as a distinctive trade union entity, boasting anti-communist overtones. However, knowing the nature of labor unions, their current anti-communist stance may not last for an extended period. This is already evident in the active involvement of prominent left-socialist activists led by Takano Minoru. Takano, with strong connections to the Kyosan-to, is determined to persuade the Sohyo unions to move away from their anti-communist perspective, notwithstanding the recent initiative adopted during the convention."

The leftists, predominantly led by Minoru Takano, advocated for adopting the Shakai-to's "Principles of Peace" as the new agenda, which has triggered staunch opposition from the right-wing faction within Sohyo. The Principles of Peace include opposition to rearmament and expansion of Japan's defense forces, emphasising a total adherence to Article 9. Secondly, advocating for Japan to join the non-aligned movement and maintain neutrality in the brewing Cold War, steering away from a pro-West stance. Finally. opposing US military bases in Japan and supporting the organisation of anti-American military base protests. A pivotal moment in the convention was the rejection of the previous goal of joining the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, intensifying tensions between the opposing wings.\n\nThese principles marked a drastic shift from the agenda set in the first convention, indicating a significant move within the political spectrum in less than a year. Now under the new leadership of the left-socialist Minoru Takano, Sohyo has unsurprisingly adapted a leftist stance, openly rejecting the pro-American policies of Japan."

A notable point of contention arose regarding the newly-enforced Treaty of Francisco. The right-wing members advocated for a more conciliatory approach, emphasising cooperation with the government, while the left-wing faction insisted on an aggressive opposition strategy. The latter aligned closely with the policies of Shakai-to's left-wing splinter group, Shakai-to Uha. In a decision reflecting the dominance of the left within Sohyo, the higher-ups resolved to support the Shakai-to Uha, unequivocally affirming the leftist orientation of the organisation. Susumu Fujita emerged as the newly elected Committee Chairman of Densan, further solidifying the left-leaning leadership. Additionally, Minoru Takano retained his position as secretary general. Despite the contentious issues discussed during the convention, no concessions were made to appease the right-wing faction. Consequently, the internal conflict between the left and right within Sohyo has intensified, signaling a deepening ideological schism within Sohyo."

These principles, rooted in Marxism and Leninism, encompass various aspects, including opposition to capitalistic rationalisation, the unification of the labour front, the protection and maintenance of peace, and the stabilisation of peacetime economy. Remarkably, Sohyo underwent a substantial transformation within a brief span of three years. Originating as an anti-communist movement, the organisation has now embraced a stance entirely opposite to its earlier position.\n\nWithin the Sohyo framework, a faction known as Minroren has emerged, comprised of right-wing unions seeking to moderate the organization's policies from within. However, three right-wing unions, namely Kaiin, Zensen Domei, and Zeneien, have reached a breaking point with Sohyo's left-dominated direction.

Additionally, the right-wing members of Sohyo aligned with the Minroren faction, alongside the right-wingers of Sodomei, were present, collectively forming the right-leaning Zenro Kaigi as a formidable rival to Sohyo.\n\nZenro's primary objective is to counter Sohyo's leftist pursuits, aiming to eliminate all pro-Communist tendencies within affiliated labor unions and positioning itself on the side of the 'free world'. The organization also denounces politically motivated strike activities, particularly those orchestrated by Sohyo, and expresses the intent to seek affiliation with the ICFTU. In contrast to a hard-line socialist stance, Zenro leans towards a more moderate social democracy. Notably, the council opposes immediate rearmament for Japan, advocating instead for a guarantee of Japan's security through the United Nations.\n\nPresently boasting a membership of 700,000, Zenro Kaigi's future growth may serve as an indicator of the Japanese labour movement's evolving political trajectory. The polarisation suggests the initiation of a mini cold war within the labour politics."

Established a decade ago in 1948, Sanbetsu Kaigi was initially hailed as one of the prominent national industrial councils. However, fractures within the organisation were evident right from its inception. The inclusion of pro-democratic elements triggered disputes with leftist sympathisers, resulting in early-stage attrition of its membership. The presence of the Mindo faction, an anti-communist group, further exacerbated internal divisions as left-leaning members sought closer ties with the Kyosan-to. By 1949, during the peak of the 'Red Purge,' Sanbetsu Kaigi grappled to maintain its eminence. The expulsion of left-wing activists from workplaces nationwide shattered its legitimacy, leading to a cascade of splits in labor unions and withdrawals from the council. The year 1950 proved to be the worst one for the organisation, as the occupation authorities directly suppressed the Kyosan-to and affiliated groups, including Sanbetsu Kaigi. The loss of a majority of its civil servants from key positions ensued. The establishment of Sohyo later that summer dealt a final blow, prompting a significant exodus of major constituent unions to Sohyo. Despite nearly eight years of stumbling and futile attempts to regain prominence, the members have now opted to dissolve the organisation for good."

Prior to the merger, discussions took place between Kokukyo-to's Miki and Minshu-to's Ashida. They deliberated on the necessity of creating a broad-based party that could accommodate some socialist elements. However, due to practical considerations, merging with the right wing of Shakai-to was deemed unpleasible. While Ashida did not publicly oppose Miki's stance, he recognised the urgent issues of Minshu-to, including a shortage of human resources and political funds.\n\nIn light of these considerations, an agreement for the merger was reached, leading to the formation of Kokumin-to with the democrat Gizo Tomabechi as the chairman.

The division within the Shakai-to has played a pivotal role in fracturing socialist political endeavors. However, the ongoing Yoshida-Hatoyama rivalry has left the conservative camp in disarray, which can jeopardies their winning streak. Sensing the vulnerability, discussions have emerged between the right and left wings of Shakai-to regarding a unified front against the conservatives. The prospect of a united Shakai-to poses a significant threat, capable of overpowering the divided conservative parties.\n\nSimultaneously, the Jiyu-to and Minshu-to leaders find themselves under pressure from the business community (Keidanren). The Keidanren asserts the necessity of a stable conservative coalition to counterbalance the rising influence of the Shakai-to. This urgency stems from the Keidanren's commitment to technological innovation and production rationalisation. They argue that a stable conservative government is vital for maintaining a positive relationship with the United States; on the other hand, the socialists openly advocate an anti-US agenda.\n\nAmidst these considerations, there is a growing sentiment that a merger between Jiyu-to and Minshu-to should be seriously entertained, especially considering the imperative nature of the situation. The Keidanren's insistence on prompt action underscores the belief that a consolidated conservative front is essential for averting the potential rise of the Shakai-to and securing a stable political environment conducive to their economic interests.

According to Ogata, Jiyu-to is anticipated to experience a maximum loss of ten seats, while the Minshu-to could potentially gain up to 20 seats. This could leave Jiyu-to with a 30-seat plurality, indicating a shift in the conservative camp.\n\nOgata has voiced his desire for a merger with Minshu-to, albeit recognising the need for approximately three months of groundwork. He views key figures within Minshu-to, including Secretary-General Nobusuke Kishi, Finance Minister Hisato Ichimada, and Minshu-to Advisor Hitoshi Ashida, as an excellent group with whom discussions about the potential merger could be fruitful. Expressing determination to lay the foundation for a conservative absolute majority within a year, Ogata has not ruled out the possibility of revising election laws if deemed necessary for achieving this ambitious goal.\n\nOgata also highlights the decision by Kyosan-to to employ regular election methods, foreseeing both positive and negative consequences. On the positive side, Ogata believes that the communist candidates may split the leftist vote, potentially costing the Shakai-to seats and thereby aiding the conservatives. However, he notes the potential downside where the Kyosan-to could be perceived by the Japanese people as an ordinary parliamentary party rather than as a tool influenced by the USSR.

From that day, he says that he realised that he had been betrayed, and he completely changed his attitude towards Yoshida and from the very next day he ordered Yomiuri to change its editorial policy to oppose Yoshida's party.\n\nAt the time of the political crisis of last November, he said that he maintained intimate liaison with Banboku Ono, Chairman of the Executive Board of Jiyu-to and worked toward resignation of Yoshida cabinet instead of Diet dissolution.

Tatsuo Morito and Junzo Inamura, representing the party's right-wing and left-wing factions respectively, found themselves in a contentious clash, each advocating for their distinct proposals. Morito's stance depicted the party as a 'national party,' aligning with anti-communist principles within the framework of parliamentary rules. Conversely, Inamura's proposal portrayed the party as a 'class party' aiming to revolutionise the social system, potentially collaborating with Kyosan-to and other far-left lawmakers.\n\nUltimately, under the mediation of Seiichi Katsumada, a resolution emerged, defining the party's character in the campaign policy as "a democratic organisation of the broad working masses, with the working class at its core, encompassing peasants, small and medium-sized businesspeople, and the intellectual class." The overall tone of the campaign policy leaned strongly towards a leftist perspective. As a result, Mosaburo Suzuki, representing the left-wing faction, assumed the position of secretary-general, displacing the right-wing Inajiro Asanuma.

The roots of this division can be traced back to 1945 when the party coalesced from various proletarian factions, each harboring diverse and often conflicting interpretations of socialism.\n\nThe initial fissures within Shakai-to became apparent in 1948 when six left-wing members were ousted from the Ashida cabinet, a move intended to quell opposition to the budget plan. Tensions escalated as the popularity of the right-wing waned, particularly in the aftermath of the notorious Showa Denko scandal. The Morito-Inamura controversy, just two years prior, further fueled discord, as the campaign policies of the opposing wings sharply contradicted each other's ideals. Notably, the left-wing's influence burgeoned with substantial support from the Sohyo unions, a trend that gained momentum during the Korean War. Today, the final blow to the already fragile unity occurred in a dispute over endorsing the Treaty of San Francisco. The right wing, being in favour, of it argued that acceptance would be the only realistic way to regain Japan's sovereignty; the left wing, being opposed to it, argued that acceptance would make Japan formally join the western bloc, antagonising the USSR.\n\nConsequently, Shakai-to now stands divided into two factions. The rightist Shakai-to Uha, led by Jotaro Kawakami, adheres to a moderate policy. On the other side, the leftist Shakai-to Saha, led by Mosaburo Suzuki, staunchly follows a revolutionary assertive policy, fueled with anti-Americanism and rejection of the US-Japan Security Treaty. This rupture may portend a potential decline of socialism in Japan, at least in the immediate future."

Although his involvement remains unverified, ongoing debates within the National Diet session centre around summoning him as a witness to the scandal. However, no information has warranted a raid on his office at this time."

 jap_shipbuilding.5.d: "Chief Cabinet Secretary, Kenji Fukunaga, calmly addressed a group of reporters inside the hallowed halls of the House of Representatives. Waving a letter, he read aloud the official authorisation for the arrest of Jiro Arita, a House of Representatives member and director of Namura Kisen Co. Upon the completion of the reading, various reactions unfolded among the gathered reporters. Some displayed disappointment at the lack of dramatic revelations, while others relished the opportunity to secure a substantial scoop. The issued arrest warrant signifies a measured step by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office, expecting Arita to turn himself in within the stipulated week."

The Diet, in a plenary session yesterday, granted permission to the prosecutors office for Arita's arrest, with the condition that the period of detention be limited to one week. In a subdued scene at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office, police officials arrested Arita without incident. A crowd of reporters gathered to cover the event, capturing the unassuming surrender. The approved arrest marks a significant step in the ongoing investigation, maintaining a measured approach as authorities delve into the scandal case even more."

 jap_shipbuilding.7.d: "Following an arrest warrant for Eisaku Sato, Secretary-General of Jiyu-to, issued yesterday in connection to the shipbuilding scandal on charges of third-party bribery, Justice Minister Takeru Inukai made an unexpected move today. Citing Article 14 of the Public Prosecutor's Office Law, Inukai invoked his command authority, ordering Prosecutor General Tosuke Sato to suspend the arrest. The rationale presented was the ongoing deliberations of crucial bills in the National Diet, deeming the presence of the Secretary-General necessary. However, Justice Minister Inukai simultaneously announced his resignation as well, effective tomorrow, with Ryogoro Kato expected to succeed him. The reasons for resignation remain undisclosed for now."

Expectations were high for the motion's approval, potentially heralding the ousting of the Yoshida Cabinet.\n\nHowever, in an unexpected turn of events, internal divisions within the Kaishin-to party intervened, securing the Cabinet's survival. Disputes and differing opinions within Kaishin-to led to a last-minute rejection of the motion, as members cast negative votes and abstentions. Adding a peculiar note to the proceedings, leaflets were hurled from the audience during a committee chairman's speech. The disruptor, Shinoda Minoru of the Dai-Nippon Aikoku-to, was promptly ejected from the venue."

 jap_shipbuilding.9.d: "The Budget Committee convened today to conclude its inquiries into the shipbuilding scandal. Prosecutor General Tosuke Sato carefully opened his furoshiki wrapping containing "professional secrets" and skimmed through the materials before taking stand and giving his testimony. Committee Chairman Tanaka Akira sternly observed, puffing a cigar in the background.\n\nSato asserted that the invocation of command authority by Justice Minister greatly impeded the shipbuilding scandal investigation. This use of authority, purportedly to shield politicians, has eroded the political legitimacy of Japan's democratic system, marking a regrettable setback. He also hinted at an underlying agenda, suggesting a plan to manipulate legal appointments by invoking command authority. Acknowledging internal conflicts, Sato admitted a divergence in prosecution policy, particularly concerning evidence evaluation. Senior prosecutors, uneasy about the Special Investigation Department's forceful approach, discreetly proposed to the Justice Minister to halt the investigation through command authority.\n\nSato confirmed monetary exchanges between the shipbuilding industry and Jiyu-to but highlighted the challenge of proving bribery with irrevocable evidence. The Shipbuilding Scandal chapter concludes with 71 arrests and 35 indictments. Of these, 23 had significant involvement, 7 were acquitted, 12 received suspended sentences, and 2 were fined. Both Prosecutor General and the Tokyo District Chief Prosecutor signal the end, with no plans of further raids, investigations, or arrests."

This move continues to be exploited by opposition lawmakers seeking to tarnish the reputation of the already-struggling Yoshida Cabinet.\n\nIn an understated but significant move, Tanaka Akira, Chairman of the Budget Committee, along with members from four opposition parties' Accounts Committee, visited the Supreme Public Prosecutors Office to meet with Prosecutor General Tosuke Sato and Chief Prosecutor Baba Yoshitsugu of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. During the meeting, a formal complaint was submitted to Chief Prosecutor Yoshitsugu, accusing Prime Minister Yoshida of violating the Parliamentary Testimony Law. The complaint alleges that Yoshida's refusal to appear before the committee was unjustified, citing official duties and overseas trip preparations as inadequate reasons to bypass the legal obligation to testify.\n\nAs the Yoshida Cabinet grapples with existing challenges, the opposition's critique further intensifies, creating additional hurdles for the already-embattled administration."

 jap_anpo.1.d: "As Prime Minister Kishi seeks to establish a new Japan-US Security Treaty, the national politics have been fraught with tension. However, recent events have greatly increased the uncertainity. In the aftermath of Kishi's failed attempt to force through the Police Duties Bill, his credibility has plummeted, tarnishing his reputation as a leader. The public now views him with suspicion, getting unpleasant memories of pre-war authoritarianism from his actions.\n\nThis has strengthened opposition movements, and has culiminated into the formation of Anpo Joyaku Kaitei Soshi Kokumin Kaigi (abbreviated Anpo Kokumin Kaigi). It is a mixed-bag umbrella coalition of 134 leftist organisations, comprising anti-nuclear activists, Zengakuren activists, anti-US base campaigners, socialist and communist parties, labour unions, women's groups, and more. This national organisation aims to organise various "national actions" nationwide to stir up masses against Kishi's proposals, where its member organisations would cooperate to conduct protest activities.\n\nThe Anpo Kokumin Kaigi seeks not to negotiate, but to terminate the Security Treaty altogether. Despite Kishi's intentions to present a revised and better Security Treaty to appeal the public, the left-wing agitators remain stubborn in their demand for its complete termination. As tensions escalate and the rift between government and opposition deepens, our country stands at crossroads, where developments could possibly lead to the biggest political turmoil in our nation's history so far."

Firstly, it establishes a commitment for both countries to prioritise the peaceful resolution of international disputes, with a particular emphasis on the United Nations as the primary forum for addressing aggression. Secondly, the revised treaty addresses a longstanding ambiguity by explicitly stating that the United States will come to Japan's defense in the event of an attack by a third party. Additionally, it mandates that the US will engage in consultation with Japan regarding the deployment of its troops on Japanese soil, and states that the Japanese government must be consulted prior to significant changes in US force deployment within Japan or the utilisation of Japanese bases for non-defensive combat operations. Plus, the treaty delineates the respective jurisdictions of both countries concerning crimes committed in Japan by US military personnel.\n\nDespite the considerable improvements in the new treaty compared to the original version signed in 1951, the Anpo Kokumin Kaigi persists in its resistance, driven by the long-held resentment among left-wing agitators against the presence of US bases on Japanese soil. Instead of accepting the revised treaty, the organisation continues to advocate for getting rid of the treaty entirely."

Thus, around 1000 bunkajin (people of culture) – a mixed assortment of intellectuals, artists, writers, performers, and cultural critics – gathered at Hibiya Park, were they founded the Anpo Hihan no Kai, calling themselves the "Society for Criticising the Security Treaty." Operating under this banner, they have aligned with the ongoing movement against the security treaty, engaging in peaceful demonstrations in the streets, at times collaborating with the Anpo Kokumin Kaigi."

However, a group of radicals from the mainstream faction of the Zengakuren, accompanied by allied militant labour unionists, breached the grounds of the National Diet compound, overcoming a guard line consisting of 5000 police officers. Within the compound, they chanted protest songs and engaged in snake dances for several hours before dispersing peacefully. Approximately 26,500 demonstrators participated. This intrusion into the National Diet has drawn widespread condemnation, including from factions within the Anpo Kokumin Kaigi. However, it has also effectively drawn attention to the anti-treaty movement, energising previously inactive groups on the left."

To evade arrest, he had taken refuge in the dormitories of the College of General Education at the University of Tokyo's Komaba Campus since last month. Today marked the Anpo Kokumin Kaigi's 'Ninth United Action', prompting Shimizu to leave the University of Tokyo with 1000 students to join Zengakuren's rally in Hibiya. However, they encountered police opposition on their route, resulting in a clash between Shimizu's supporters and law enforcement. After the scuffle, Shimizu was finally arrested and placed under police custody.\n\nMeanwhile, in Osaka, students of Osaka City University organised a strike as part of the Ninth United Action."

However, their departure was met with fierce resistance. Around 700 radicals from the Zengakuren gathered at the airport in an attempt to prevent the delegation from leaving. The students occupied the lobby, broke into the cafeteria, and erected a barricade. The situation escalated, leading to a confrontation with police forces. Eventually, the authorities cleared the area, arresting seventy-eight students in the process.

The treaty is a significant improvement from the Japanese perspective, as it commits the US to defend Japan in the event of an attack, requires prior consultation before dispatching US forces overseas, removes the clause for suppressing domestic disturbances, and specifies a 10-year term, after which it can be abrogated with one year's notice.\n\nHowever, despite the improvement, many Japanese especially from the left-wing spectrum still resent the presence of US military bases on Japanese soil and hope to get rid of the treaty entirely.

Demonstrations by left-wing activists in major cities have become commonplace, with mass gatherings and protests in front of the National Diet and the Prime Minister's residence. Occasional clashes between Zengakuren radicals and the police add to the tension.\n\nThe world watches as Japan faces what appears to be the largest protests in its history, slowly plunging the nation into political instability.

The opposition Shakai-to is employing every parliamentary delaying tactic available, aiming to drag out the debate and give the anti-treaty movement more time to gather support. Their ultimate goal is to extend the debate beyond the end of the Diet session in May, hoping that this prolonged scrutiny will lead to anti-treaty and anti-Kishi elements within the Jimin-to itself ousting Prime Minister Kishi and shelving the treaty.\n\nThe Socialists' strategy has proven highly effective. Astute questioning by Socialist leaders has brought to light several questionable aspects of the new treaty. Kishi's surly and evasive responses during these sessions have not helped his cause; instead, they have turned the media, previously in favour of the treaty, towards supporting the Socialists' call for more discussion. Key points such as the nature of "prior consultation" and the definition of the term "Far East" still remains particularly vague and contentious."

Last week, five thousand protestors gathered in front of the National Diet at night, waving red flags, and holding paper lanterns. Most of the protestors were workers from the Sohyo. Recently, the 13th United Action was organised by the Anpo Kokumin Kaigi, with an assembly at the Ogimachi Public Pool in Osaka where the anti-treaty movement leaders gave impassioned speeches to the crowd.

In Tokyo, approximately six thousand students attempted to breach the National Diet grounds. The police, stationed at the main gate, managed to thwart their advance, leading to intense confrontations. Amidst the chaos, determined students were seen scaling police trucks in an effort to push through the barriers.\n\nMeanwhile, in Osaka, the local faction of the Zengakuren organised parallel activities. The Osaka City University saw a complete strike as students called for the abandonment of classes in solidarity with the national movement.

Chants of "Stop Anpo!" echoed through the downtown area, signaling widespread discontent. Today, the protests intensified as the Zengakuren faction in Osaka seized the moment to voice their dissatisfaction. The rising subway ticket prices provided the perfect pretext for the demonstrations, which were primarily fueled by opposition to the security treaty.\n\nThe wave of protests has not been confined to Tokyo and Osaka. Major cities across the nation are experiencing similar upheavals. The situation has escalated to the point where up to ten million petition letters denouncing the security treaty have been delivered to the House of Representatives' visiting room.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Kishi's paranoia is becoming increasingly evident, and it will be no surprise if the mounting pressure would push him towards a reckless decision..."

This morning in a "sneak attack", the Jimin-to lawmakers abruptly extended the Diet session by fifty days. In retaliation, opposition Shakai-to lawmakers staged a sit-in, blocking House Speaker Ichiro Kiyose from calling a vote. Meanwhile, anti-treaty protestors swiftly gathered by several thousands outside the National Diet building.\n\nIgnoring Kiyose's pleas to cease their disruption, the Shakai-to lawmakers faced the arrival of 500 police officers. The nation watched in shock on NHK television as the police officers forcibly removed each Socialist lawmaker from the building and the Jimin-to lawmakers, unopposed, quickly passing the motion to extend the session. However, Kishi's "sneak attack" continued as the House Speaker also unexpectedly called for a vote on the new security treaty.

 jap_anpo.15.d: "Everyone had been expecting Kishi to try to extend the Diet session, but few, even within his own party, realised he was also planning to ratify the treaty simultaneously. This was a crafty manoeuvre because, under Diet rules at the time, any treaty passed by the lower house would automatically be approved after thirty days, even without action by the upper house, as long as the Diet remained in session during that period.\n\nBy passing the treaty through the lower house on such day, Kishi ensured that it would automatically be ratified on June 19, just in time for President [USA.GetLeader]'s arrival in Japan that day. However, this manoeuvre may have been too clever. It made Kishi appear to be grovelling before the US President and has closely linked the fate of the treaty and the related protests to [USA.GetLeader]'s visit, which had not previously been viewed as particularly related to the treaty's ratification.\n\nHence, this timing has only ensured that the protests would now take on a stronger anti-American tone than they had previously displayed."

This portrayal has been only further emboldened by the recent May 19th Incident.\n\nWith that, the media has completely turned against him, with even conservative newspapers like Nihon Keizai Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun calling for the mass resignation of the Kishi Cabinet. The nation's business community, known as the zaikai, has also grown increasingly worried about the ongoing political turmoil, which threatens to badly affect Japan's business and international trade, thus also pressuring Kishi to resign."

The anti-mainstream party members believed that only the Diet session extension would be voted on. However, they were unaware that Kishi would also maneuver to have the new security treaty voted on, keeping them in the dark.\n\nDuring the vote, 27 Jimin-to lawmakers, including faction leaders such as Tanzan Ishibashi, Kenzo Matsumura, Ichiro Kono, and Takeo Miki, boycotted the vote in protest. These factions, now harbouring anti-Kishi sentiments, are publicly demanding Kishi's resignation. Kono is mostly leading this movement and has threatened to leave the party along with his allies if the situation deteriorates further.

Anti-treaty protesters, supported by the Osaka Workers Union, spilled onto the streets and gathered in front of the prefectural government office, voicing their discontent.\n\nThe anti-security treaty movement has now incorporated anti-Kishi sentiments, seeking not only to prevent the treaty's ratification but also to secure the resignation of Prime Minister Kishi, whose recent actions are seen as undemocratic and reminiscent of pre-war authoritarianism."

She attended high school in Ashiya, Hyogo, and after graduating, returned to Tokyo for her higher education. There, she joined the Kyosan-to and the Zengakuren, becoming an activist and participating in the anti-treaty movement as the secretary general of the communist league faction of the Zengakuren. She was among the 78 students arrested during the occupation of the Haneda Airport lobby in January. Along with her fellow mainstream Zengakuren activists, she also participated in several attempted intrusions into the Diet and the Prime Minister's official residence.\n\nHowever, during the June 15th Incident, when the police retaliated after students occupied the Diet premises for an extended period, she died from severe injuries sustained in the clashes. The exact circumstances of her death remain disputed: police claim she was knocked down and trampled to death, while students blame her death on physical assaults by police officers.\n\nNonetheless, her death has shocked the nation and received extensive media coverage. It is seen as a "triple tragedy": she was young, a student at an elite university, and a woman.

The mainstream faction of the party, under the leadership of Kyuichi Tokuda, rebuffed the Cominform's criticisms and issued a rebuttal, arguing that it failed to consider the practical realities of Japan. However, Kenji Miyamoto took a contrary stance, advocating for acknowledgment and respect of the Cominform's critique. He went as far as labeling Tokuda and his supporters as 'right-wing opportunists' and 'Titoists'.

The working class must organise small militant groups to disperse, disrupt, and attack the armed forces of the enemy.\n     Militant bases in rural areas must always be integrated with urban centers and developed under the guidance of the working class. They require a stronghold from which to defend and progress against adversaries. The primary base for the activists will be centrally managed, serving as the centre of regional resistance, extending to mountainous terrains and villages. These locales have been pivotal in shaping rural society for centuries and boast a legacy of revolutionary peasant uprisings. In numerous instances, entire villages have succumbed to destruction within a span of two to three years under layers of feudal oppression, exploitation, excessive taxation, subsidies, and escalating unemployment. So, these peasants have two options: destruction or revolution.\n     For the mountainous regions and villages, it is imperative that workers undertake revolutionary efforts and establish the necessary bases for such endeavours. Specifically, it is essential to lay the groundwork such as rear areas of Keihin, Hanshin, Kitakyushu, Chukyo, Sorachi, and Sapporo.\n     The militants are a weapon for the development of a national united front of anti-American salvation and will be carried out with the aim of developing into a people's liberation army.""

Consequently, the Kyosan-to's mission is to spearhead a 'national liberation revolution,' aiming to liberate the Japanese nation from American dominance and dismantle the 'semi-feudal reactionary forces' present within Japan. Rejecting the notion of a 'peaceful revolution,' the platform emphasises that Japan's transformation necessitates armed struggle and the use of force, dismissing the idea of democratic and pacifist approaches.\n\nThe agenda further asserts the imperative of shielding 'our comrades' from the adversary's armed forces and ultimately defeating them to overthrow the Yoshida government.

Upon converging at Suita, the protestors chanted anti-war slogans and demanded the cessation of cargo trains. Subsequently, clashes erupted as the mob hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at police stations, patrol cars, and the vehicle of US Brigadier General Carter W. Clark, leaving him with severe injuries. As the protestors attempted to board a train for their next destination, they were intercepted by around thirty police officers, sparking a confrontation on the station platform.\n\nThe altercation resulted in injuries to protestors, law enforcement personnel, and innocent bystanders.

Some individuals armed themselves with Molotov cocktails and bamboo spears, resulting in the destruction of a police broadcast van and vandalism of several vehicles.

Following an official meeting on August 5th, amidst a tea break in the Japanese Embassy's garden in the UK, Yakov Malik, head of the Soviet delegation, unexpectedly hinted at a potential concession: the possible handover of Habomai and Shikotan islands to Japan. This indication materialised into an official proposal during a subsequent meeting on the 9th, wherein the Soviet Union formally suggested the return of Habomai and Shikotan. Yet, hopes for a breakthrough were dashed when a confidential telegram from Japanese envoy Shunichi Matsumoto to Prime Minister Hatoyama, advocating for the acceptance of the offer, was intercepted and discarded by Foreign Minister Shigemitsu.\n\nPushed by the Foreign Ministry officials and American diplomats, Shigemitsu and his allies urged for a more assertive stance, demanding the return of all four islands, including Etorofu and Kunashiri. Later on August 27, a directive from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was telegraphed to Matsumoto: "We must not compromise on the return of two islands. We must insist on the return of four islands." Despite the directive, Soviet resistance remained unyielding. The Soviet side was not willing to make more concessions and immediately rejected the proposal to return all four islands. As a result, the talks broke down and no compromise was reached.\n\nAs negotiations crumbled, the Soviets retaliated by unilaterally imposing the 'Bulganin Line,' prohibiting Japanese fishing vessels from accessing parts of Kuril Islands waters, in an evident reprisal for the diplomatic deadlock.

The agreement includes the provision of easing the restrictions imposed by the Bulganin Line, thereby offering a glimmer of hope to Hokkaido's upset fishermen. However, the agreement also specified the types and quantities of fish that Japanese fishing vessels were allowed to catch within the 200 nautical mile zone. Furthermore, the number of fishing vessels allowed to enter the zone was restricted, required a permit issued by the Soviet government, and were required to report the amount of fishing they caught and keep a diary of their operations. The Japan-Soviet Fisheries Committee was also established, which would meet at least once a year to decide on cooperative regulatory measures for salmon, trout, herring, crab, etc. to conserve and increase stocks and maintain maximum sustainable productivity.\n\nThere have also been remours of a certain 'secret agreement' between Kono and the Soviet Premier. Speculation suggests that during the negotiations, Kono may have acceded to a condition proposed by the Soviets. Allegedly, in exchange for permitting fishing within the previously restricted area, Kono may have withdrawn Japan's demand for the return of Etorofu and Kunashiri, two disputed islands.\n\nNonetheless, the thaw in strained diplomatic relations has opened the door for further dialogue.

Despite initial acceptance of Hatoyama's conditions by the Soviets, concerns lingered regarding the territorial issue. Hence, Hatoyama re-dispatched Shunichi Matsumoto to secure a firm commitment to future negotiations over territorial issues.

Kishi, puffing on a cigarette, chuckled and nodded approvingly, "Indeed it is!" With a nod from Kishi, the motion was then passed to their unexpected allies, the socialist leaders Hiroo Wada and Inejiro Asanuma, representing both right-wing and left-wing socialist parties. The two socialist leaders affixed their signatures to the paper, sealing their commitment to this political upheaval. With the document finalised, the opposition leaders handed it over to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yasujiro Tsutsumi, who had been standing beside them, keenly observing the proceedings. A smile graced Tsutsumi's face as he graciously accepted the paper, thanking the opposition representatives for their time and dedication.\n\nLater in the day, during the plenary session of the House of Representatives, the no-confidence motion was put to vote and passed successfully."

 jap_yoshida.2.d:0 "With the ongoing uncertainity revolving around the fate of the Yoshida Cabinet, news reporters were gathered outside the National Diet building for information as the House of Representatives Speaker, Yasujiro Tsutsumi, addressed the anxious crowd. Suddenly, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kenji Fukunaga rushed toward him, a sense of urgency etched on his face. \"Tsutsumi-san! Tsutsumi-san!\" Fukunaga exclaimed, handing over an official notice from none other than Prime Minister Yoshida himself. As the Speaker carefully perused the document, it became evident that something of great significance was afoot.\n\nSwiftly, Tsutsumi organised an impromptu press conference, beckoning journalists to gather for a major announcement. Amidst a flurry of camera flashes, Fukunaga, with a face of sorrow, read aloud the contents of the official notice. The Yoshida Cabinet had finally taken the step of resigning en masse.\n\nWithin moments, a swarm of reporters descended upon the Prime Minister's residence, their lenses capturing every official luxury car that emerged. In one such photograph, Vice Prime Minister Taketora Ogata was captured sitting in the backseat with an unhappy expression. Unconfirmed reports hinted at a heated argument between Yoshida and Ogata, stemming from the Prime Minister's contemplation of dissolving the House of Representatives which was staunchly opposed by Ogata, who, in turn, convinced Yoshida to opt for resignation.\n\nMeanwhile, at the headquarters of the Minshu-to party, lawmakers gathered around radios, hanging on to every word as the official statement echoed through the airwaves. A wave of elation swept through the room as the news spread – the Yoshida Cabinet had resigned. Banzai cheers erupted, echoing the relief and joy that had been pent up within the party's leaders.\n\nThe resignation will be effective by the 10th, and Ichiro Hatoyama is expected to be the next Prime Minister."

 jap_yoshida.3.t:0 "Kimura's Proposal"
 jap_yoshida.3.d:0 "Tokutaro Kimura, the Minister of Justice in Yoshida's cabinet, is secretly known for his far-right stance and encouraging the resurgence of uyoku dantai amidst growing left-wing unrest. Recently, he has put forth a preposterous proposition to the Prime Minister, aimed at bolstering his anti-left agenda. This proposal advocates for the establishment of a formidable force dubbed the "Anti-Communist Battotai," comprising 200,000 members drawn from various uyoku factions, alongside boryokudan and tekiya syndicates. The objective is to quash both leftist radicals and the militant activities associated with Kyosan-to sympathizers.\n\nHowever, before endorsing this plan, it demands careful scrutiny, as it risks not only welcoming criminal elements onto our streets but also exacerbating uyoku radicalism within our nation, a move that may not align with American interests. Should we embrace this proposal, or reject it in favour of upholding peace and justice in our country?"

 jap_yoshida.4.t:0 "Enactment of the Subversive Activities Prevention Act"
 jap_yoshida.4.d:0 "The Yoshida Cabinet has recently implemented the Subversive Activities Prevention Act in response to the unrest stirred by the Kyosan-to. This legislation empowers the government to issue directives aimed at curbing the activities, and in severe cases, disbanding organizations engaged in subversive actions that disrupt public order and incite violence. Nevertheless, the law encountered opposition, notably from the Shakai-to, who contested its proposal on grounds of constitutional rights infringement. They went as far as accusing the Yoshida Cabinet of regressing towards the totalitarian practices of the past. Despite protests from various Sohyo and Zengakuren groups during the law's drafting stage, the escalation of riots and violence during demonstrations further compelled the government to enact it.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the Yoshida Cabinet has given the following statement: "The reason for the law is that dangerous terroristic activities are being carried out by certain elements in organised groups in our country. Regrettable as it may seem, dangerous activities have been revealed which proclaim in various kinds of documents the propriety and necessity for the overthrow of the Constitution and of the government established under it. These activities also seem about to move toward the realisation of those aims by means of armed terrorism and guerrilla warfare. Moreover, this activity seems to be carried out by organized groups with international connections and appears to be strong and widely developed.""

 jap_hatoyama.1.d:0 "Today marks a huge turn in national politics as Ichiro Hatoyama assumes the title of Prime Minister, triumphing over days of political hurdles and rivalries with the Yoshida Party. Following the mass resignation of the Yoshida Cabinet yesterday, Hatoyama swiftly appointed his new cabinet, with Mamoru Shigemitsu as Vice Prime Minister. After six years of unbroken conservative rule, the Jiyu-to faction concedes power to the Minshu-to, leaving them disheartened. Notably, former Prime Minister Yoshida steps down as party chairman, passing the torch to Taketora Ogata.\n\nA charismatic diplomat, Hatoyama pledges to enhance Japan's global standing through diplomatic engagements with the USSR and United Nations membership. And despite the odds with the former chairman of Jiyu-to, Hatoyama has also expressed a desire to unite the two conservative parties."
