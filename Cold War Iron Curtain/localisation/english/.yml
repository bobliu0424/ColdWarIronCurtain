The Republic of China's Kuomintang government has fled to Taiwan, and the People's Republic of China controls the mainland.

 CHI_KOR.0.d:0 "The endless ambition of our mortal enemy in Beijing has claimed yet another victim; the fledgling Republic of Korea, long beset by the agitating of Kim Ill Sung, has collapsed into civil war, with Mao Zedong's revolution no doubt backing Sung's forces in the North as a means to combat the incoming support from the United States, themselves en route to back the republican government in Seoul; it's a situation we patriotic Chinese know this kind of conflict all to well.\n\nThe world's eyes fall on Asia once more as the Korean Civil War escalates, and the Republic of China will not stand by as the Red Menace strikes at the good people of Korea from their stronghold in Pyongyang.\n\nHowever, despite General Macarthur strongly encouraging a Nationalist China intervention in the Korean war, President Truman has openly opposed the idea, therefore the proposal of intervening in the Korean War to the United States is more than likely to fail."  
 CHI_KOR.1.d:0 "Our recent decision to involve ourselves in the civil war in Korea has caught the attention of the enemies of the PRC and their backing of Kim Ill Sung; The Republic of China in Taiwan and the remnants of the Kuomintang have extended on offer to join the US Army in fighting against the North Korean Army.\n\nWhile any attempt to impede the Red Tide in Asia is welcome, choosing to involve Taiwan might incense the government in Beijing, possibly prompting an invasion from Manchuria"
 CHI_KOR.2.d:0 "The official correspondence from Washington D.C has relayed to us that US government has signed off on the proposal from Chiang Kai-Shek, and that the United States Army shall work in concert with the Kuomintang Army in a combined effort against the North Korean Army!"
 CHI_KOR.3.d:0 "The official correspondence from Washington D.C has informed Chiang Kai-Shek of the Presidents wishes for the Republic of China not to intervene in the Korean Civil War, citing fears that any military incursion from Taiwan would invoke military reprisal from Beijing, potentially escalating the war to a international crisis."
 CHI_KOR.4.d:0 "\nWith the outbreak of the civil war in Korea, it is only natural that the enemies of the asian communist bloc supporting the communist revolt in Pyongyang would seek to join the fighting; not even a year since the Chinese Civil War have the remnants of the Kuomintang in Taiwan decided, once again, to take up arms against the Chinese Red Army backing Kim Ill Sung in North Korea.\n\nAfter recent correspondence between ROC President Chiang Kai-Shek in Taipei and American President Harry Truman in Washington, the United States have given the green light for the Kuomintang Army to aid the US Army in Korea, believing their experiences against Red Chinese forces would be of immense help against the threat they face."

ITA_trieste.6.d:0 "Excellent news has arrived from the general staff of the armed forces, our forces in Trieste have managed to secure the entirety of the Free Territory of Trieste. Per the reports, the Yugoslav army was ill prepared to face a major assault and was swiftly pushed out of the region. After pushing the Yugoslav forces out, our forces established fortifications on the border which were capable of rebuffing counter attacks by the Yugoslavian forces. This will surely help cement the current government’s legacy in attempting to salvage some of our losses from the prior war. More importantly, a failure here would surely have led to a collapse of the current government and major damage in the next elections. This said, the international response to this, especially from non-aligned and Soviet-bloc nations will surely be swift in their condemnation of our moves. Moving to ensure our NATO allies, especially the United States continues their close collaboration with our armed forces and equipment provisions will continue to be a necessity to preserve our gains."

With Marshall Tito's pressing the United Nations and the Allies to put an end to the Free Territory and possibly, annex it entirely to Yugoslavia, we must do whatever it's possible to regain what has been Italian land for ages even if by using force."

news_trieste.1.d:0 "Following a short campaign, the Italian military has successfully managed to seize control of the city of Trieste and the immediate surrounding areas. This comes after tensions over the city have flared since the conclusion of the Second World War. Following the conclusion of said war, the region was split off and put under United Nations jurisdiction via the Free Territory of Trieste. However, the region is noted for an ethnically divided population and being a major point of contention over ownership between Yugoslavia and Italy. As discussions on dissolving the Free Territory, tensions escalated into outright armed conflict between the two nations. To the surprise of the international community, Italian forces were capable of routing Yugoslav forces from both Zone A and Zone B of the territory and had announced their intentions to annex the entire area. The move has been widely condemned by Yugoslavia along with various communist nations."
