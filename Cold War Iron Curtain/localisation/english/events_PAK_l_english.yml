 Islamabad.1.d:0 "Karachi has been the capital of Pakistan since 1947. However, in the years following, the city has seen a major influx of refugees and citizens, quickly transforming from a sleepy port city to a metropolis. It is increasingly difficult for the government to find enough space to meet its needs or house the bureaucrats necessary for the functioning of the state. Karachi, the main commercial hub of the nation also puts politicians very close to business interests, which can become disruptive overtime. The weather of Karachi is also severe, especially in the summer when temperatures reach scorching highs. Its distance from GHQ in Rawalpindi and concerns over its defensibility also are of concern. After careful consideration, a high-powered commission of experts has been tasked to search Pakistan to find a suitable location for a new capital."
 Islamabad.2.d:0 "The recently established commission tasked for finding an area to construct a new capital for the country has released its report. It has identified a tract of land northeast of Rawalpindi. The location is easily accessible, undeveloped, and in ideal weather conditions. Aside from a handful of villages, the area is ripe for rapid development and construction essential to building a capital. It is geographically protected from hostile incursions and its location near GHQ will strengthen civil-military cooperation. Turning this land into a federal capital will take time, and plans are underway to temporarily move the government to Rawalpindi before it establishes itself in the new capital, which will be called Islamabad. Although the government claims the new location will make it easily accessible to all Pakistanis, there are complaints that the new capital largely favors northern Pakistanis and the military."
 Islamabad.3.d:0 "Today, on the twentieth anniversary of independence, the Pakistan government officially moved to its new capital of Islamabad. The government gave a Greek architectural firm the contract to design the capital, with construction overseen by senior federal and military officials. Many observers note the pleasant grid plan with the breathtaking Margalla Hills serving as the apex. Pakistani officials effusively praise the cleanliness and organization of the new city. Experts believe the city will quickly attract many Pakistanis eager for new opportunities. Aside from its openness and temperate climate, the city is closely connected to Rawalpindi, which hosts GHQ. Although there is a great deal of pride among citizens, there are concerns the new capital overwhelmingly benefits the military and those communities it largely recruits from."

 Project_706.1.d:0 "The recent Indian nuclear test completely transforms the regional balance of power. India has brought the threat of atomic annihilation to our doorsteps. In a secret meeting of the top military, civilian, and intelligence officers, the decision was made to activate Project 706. The objective of Project 706 is to achieve nuclear weapons capability. The government promised to provide all financial requirements while the military will oversee facilities and security. Our premier intelligence agency will search the globe to find Pakistani scientists who can be useful to the program. They will appeal to the patriotism of the officers and arrange their return home."
 Project_706.2.d:0 "Nuclear physicist Abdus Salam is the premier atomic expert in the country. He is currently at Quaid-e-Azam University, guiding leading a team of Pakistani physicists to solve problems in the field. A patriotic, intelligence Pakistani, he is the natural choice to take a leading role in Project 707. Some of the senior military and intelligence officers are dragging their feet. They are naturally reluctant to give authority to a civilian scientist, but more significantly, Abdus Salam is a member of the controversial Ahmadi community. Many Pakistanis view Ahmadis as apostates and not really Muslim. However, Prime Minister Zulfiqar Bhutto dismissed all concerns, insisting the program is paramount for the survival of the nation and every Pakistani capable of helping the project must be utilized."
 Project_706.3.d:0 "The government has approved the establishment of a Nuclear Weapons Committee. This secret group will meet and coordinate the different departments involved in nuclear weapons research. Its members include military officers, intelligence officials, civil servants, and scientists. Although some of the leading scientists expressed concern that the committee may in fact hinder research due to the members conflicting agendas, the government believes this is the best way forward. The security apparatus has made it clear they want complete oversight, even at the expense of scientific advancement. Members of the committee are thoroughly vetted to ensure they are not just loyal but obedient to the chain of command."
 Project_706.4.d:0 "In a daring intelligence operation, our agents and foreign service successfully extracted Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan from the Netherlands. Dr. A.Q. Khan, a nuclear engineer, had been working for a nuclear powerplant, secretly providing Project 706 with information on centrifuges. He had also pressed the government to consider using uranium instead of plutonium. He proved very convincing, and now that he is back home, he will play a major role for Project 706. Plans are already underway to provide him a laboratory and team so he can pursue his uranium proposal. Dr. A.Q. Khan had previously not been identified by the project, but he approached our ambassador in the Netherlands to offer his service out of a patriotic duty."
 Project_706.5.d:0 "Dr. Munir Ahmad Khan, an adept organizer and scientist, has taken on the role of overseeing Project 706. He is currently the head of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. He is coordinating with all scientific teams working on the project. In recent months, he has begun directly coordinating the acquisition of instruments, elements, and other essential materials needed to progress the program. He is especially gifted for the job. In addition, he works well with the military, explaining the progress made and why certain materials must be required."

 Nazimuddin.1.d:0 "Khawaja Nazimuddin has agreed to become the second Prime Minister of Pakistan. The former Governor-General was seen by many to be the least controversial choice due to his record. As Governor-General he exercised political neutrality in politics. The fact that both Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan openly supported him before their deaths also made Nazimuddin the ideal candidate to become Prime Minister. Prime Minister Nazimuddin is from Dacca and will be the first Bengali head of government in Pakistan. Among his first acts was to make Malik Ghulam the new Governor-General. He comes to power amidst rising political discontent from provincial nationalists and has expressed he will continue the conservative approach of his predecessor. A new era of Pakistani politics has begun. However, critics are already noting his aristocratic background and the political backlash from his Basic Principles Report do not bode well for him."
 Language_Debate.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin ignited controversy over his remarks in Dacca last month. He stated that Jinnah was right to say that for national unity, Urdu must be the only language for Pakistan. Although a Bengali, Nazimuddin remains staunchly committed to the Pakistan envisioned by Jinnah and his background as an Urdu-speaking aristocrat clouded his understanding of how sensitive the Bengali people were over the language issue. The announcement led to the formation of language committees demanding recognition for Bengali as a national language. Today, language demonstrators took to the streets of Dacca in massive numbers, despite a government ban on unlawful assembly. The protestors, mostly students, have met at the University and are gathering in large numbers. The police and East Pakistani authorities are ready to act."
 Language_Debate.2.d:0 "At Dacca University where students were protesting over the language issue, police were able to cordon off areas and used tear gas to break up protestors. As students fled, some were detained for violating the government orders and this apparently enraged the crowd. This crowd moved to the East Pakistan Assembly Building to demand their grievances be heard and as they appeared to be storming into the building, police opened fire, killing at least six but likely more students. The news of the shooting had caused citizens in Dacca to start a general strike. Over the next two days more protestors took to the streets and there were more police shootings. Support for the government dwindles among the Bengalis as they turn increasingly to left-leaning parties. The leftists promise to support the will of the people and pledge to support the language movement."

 PAK_Military.0.d:0 "A number of British military officers were retained following partition to fill the gaps and prepare officers to take important positions throughout the military command. During the recent Kashmir War, the British officers disobeyed government orders to deploy Pakistani troops to the front, greatly hindering the war-effort. The government believes removing these officers is essential for national security. To achieve this, the government recently announced it would offer British officers serving in the Pakistan Army only a one-year extension to their current contracts, set to expire soon. This has seen virtually all the British officers decline the extension and in response the government announced Pakistan would see the nationalization of the Army in a few months. The Air Force and Navy however, will retain many British officers out of necessity, but they will be phased out in the following years. The press has greatly welcomed this nationalization effort by the military. Pakistani Army officers are also excited of the prospect of rapid promotions to fill the new gaps."
 PAK_Military.1.d:0 "The government of Pakistan has announced General Ayub Khan has assumed the responsibilities of Army Chief for the Pakistan Army. He is the first native service head and his promotion has led to great fanfare in the press. The tall, Pathan officer is the son of a colonial railroad official and was one of the first Indians to be commissioned in the British Indian Army after graduating from the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. He served as a Colonel during World War II, leading operations in Burma. After the war he has held senior command positions in both West and East Pakistan. Upon taking over, the General pledged the loyalty of the Army to Pakistan and pledged he would lead efforts to begin incorporating ethnic groups long excluded from the military by the colonial state and build a truly national force for the nation. His comments were well-received by the press."

 Bogra_PM.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin was removed from office by Governor-General Ghulam Malik who invoked special powers from the 1935 Government of India Act. Some welcome the decision as Nazimuddin proved ineffective during both the language debate, the riots in Lahore, and in stopping the increasing popularity of leftist parties in the country. However, others are uneasy about the Governor-General using powers put in place by the colonial regime to ensure they controlled the governance of India. To replace Nazimuddin, the Governor-General recalled the relatively unknown ambassador to the United States, Mohammad Ali Bogra and has convinced him to be the new Prime Minister. The appointment of a career diplomat has surprised the nation and many question if he will be able to manage the increasingly divided political landscape. However, a middle-class Bengali there is hope he can calm tensions in East Pakistan. Popular in Washington, the United States is said to be excited by the new PM."
 Bogra_PM.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Ali Bogra at the Constituent Assembly laid out what is being called the Bogra Formula. The Prime Minister calls his proposals a political compromise for both wings of the country, it envisions a National Assembly based on proportional representation and a Senate with equal representation from the four provinces of West Pakistan, essentially ending one unit. He also proposed a formula for reserved seats which would ultimately lead to a parliament in which East Pakistan had more seats but through the reserved system, the West Pakistani representatives would balance out. Issues between the houses would be resolved in a joint session and the Governor-General position would lose many powers and the title would change to President. The compromise is being widely praised across the country However, the curbing of powers and shifting power towards the legislative branch is said to be making the Governor-General, military leaders, and civil service officers nervous."
 Bogra_PM.3.d:0 "Although Prime Minister Ali Bogra has worked very hard to finalize a constitution, both the one unit and his Bogra formula have stalled to facilitate a final constitution. The Constituent Assembly recently concluded that Governor-General Ghulam Malik has been hindering efforts at a political compromise in the country. In an effort to take control of the situation, the Prime Minister allowed the Constituent Assembly to discuss laws which would restrict the powers of the Governor-General and prevent him from dismissing the current government as he did with its predecessor. Ghulam Malik has responded by dismissing the Constituent Assembly, though he has not removed the Bogra government. Members of the assembly have taken the Governor-General to court over his action and in the midst of this political infighting, the Governor-General has asked for medical leave. Ghulam Malik has left the country for treatment abroad and the Interior Minister, career civil service officer Iskander Mirza has been appointed acting Governor-General."
 Bogra_PM.4.d:0 "Iskandar Mirza, the acting Governor-General, immediately began conflicting with Prime Minister Ali Bogra. He felt Bogra and his plans for a constitutional compromise were going to dramatically increase the disparity of power between the provinces and lead the country to ruin. Prime Minister Ali Bogra was quite adamant that he wanted to give the country a constitution and began discussing with political allies plans to curb the powers of the Governor-General when a new assembly arrived. However, Mirza acted first, he announced the resignation of Prime Minister Ali Bogra and informed the Governor-General he had stepped in for, Ghulam Malik, that he was also dismissed. Although Ali Bogra officially resigned, many believe the Governor-General forced him to step down. The now former Prime Minister has returned to his former position as the ambassador to the United States. As a new legislative assembly begins to take form, many believe the new Governor-General will pick the political faction that guarantees his power."
 
 Bohla_Cyclone.1.d:0 "As the aftermath of Tropical Storm Nora moved towards the Bay of Bengal, it slowly transformed into a cyclone called Bohla. The devastating storm hit East Pakistan directly, moving north before it ended in Assam. The storm has caused extensive casualties, with the number of deaths numbering in the tens of thousands. The Pakistan Meteorological Department failed to predict or warn the population of the storm, leading to even more losses. Although the Pakistan military in East Pakistan deployed aircraft, ships, and troops to provide relief, many Bengalis are furious with the government. The federal government has failed to coordinate a response, and many complain there are massive shortages in relief supplies. For many Bengalis, the perceived lackluster response is seen as confirmation to the second-class status East Pakistan is viewed as by the federal government."
 Bohla_Cyclone.2.d:0 "A stationary cyclone rapidly accelerated north of the Bay of Bengal and made landfall in East Pakistan by that evening, near Chittagong. The Pakistan Meteorological Department did issue an alert, but many locals were not sure what it entailed. 144 km/h winds, with a storm tide peaking at 4 meters. The impact was devastating. Local authorities report entire villages and island populations were annihilated by the storm. In the areas hit by the storm locals report nearly ninety percent of structures were destroyed. Millions are affected and casualties are said to number the hundreds of thousands. The government claims to be providing as much support as possible but media outlets and locals are criticizing the response. The estimated damage is immense and international aid is being prepared."


 COMPAK_Kashmir.1.d:0 "Flush with Soviet arms and imbued with confidence by his Soviet advisors, General Akbar Khan has presented the Party with an ultimatum. The General noted the officers like him who supported the coup did so out of a belief that action was needed in Kashmir before India grew too powerful. Now Akbar Khan has declared the time is ripe for action to resolve Kashmir successfully. The senior Party leadership read this demand for action and believe the country is not ready for such action as the revolution continue. However, they do believe there are two options. One is to give Akbar Khan the greenlight to initiate a border skirmish with India, this should sate the appetite of the military for a time. The other option is to remove Akbar Khan and replace him with someone more cool-headed like General Musa Khan"
 COMPAK_Kashmir.2.d:0 "The recent conflict ended in victory for our forces. Due to the revolutionary fervor and skill of our forces we triumphed over our enemy. They lack proper motivation to resist our forces. The nation was galvanized by our success and those who participated in the operations are being extensively praised in the media. The military high command is now doubt feeling very good with the results and will be satisfied for the time being. The political leadership is also happy with the outcome as they are using it as justification for why the revolution was necessary. The limited scope of the operation was enough to satisfy our objectives and not enough of an escalation to push the Indians to expand their operations. With this success we will continue to build our military and prepare for a future final resolution to our dispute with the Indians. The India media is downplaying recent events as a minor border skirmish with not clear result."
 COMPAK_Kashmir.3.d:0 "Despite the gallant and brave efforts of our armed forces on the border, the recent fighting did not go as we had hoped. The enemy proved much tougher than anticipated. Our media is portraying the battles as a heroic effort with successes, though within the military the truth is widely known and morale took a blow at this setback. Some officers are even rumbling that the recent purges and new direction were the cause of the failed performance. Those officers we identified will be dealt with. Despite the failure, the results have cooled some of the more hawkish leaders within the military. It will greatly strengthen the hands of our party and political leadership. We can concentrate on transforming the country and building up the capabilities and revolutionary fervor of our military. When the time comes, we will strike the blow that will not only liberate the people of Kashmir but all workers in India."

 Bangladesh_Independence.1.d:0 "News of Ayub Khan assuming the Presidency has sent massive crowds surging across East Pakistan, especially in Dacca. The people of East Pakistan have long felt neglected by the center and this newest development appears to have confirmed their suspicion that the coup was a plot by the West Pakistani dominated military to seize the country for itself, especially since it had now removed Iskandar Mirza, a Bengali. Surging crowds in Dacca marched largely unchallenged as local police appeared unwilling to intervene. The small number of soldiers from the 14th Division guarding the East Pakistan Assembly were forced to fight their way to the cantonment area, resulting in heavy civilian and military casualties. The cantonment is now under a virtual siege and the locally raised East Pakistan Rifles battalions across East Pakistan are defecting to the people in droves. Virtually all their West Pakistani compatriots are now under armed guard."
 Bangladesh_Independence.2.d:0 "Since independence the Pakistani government has maintained a small garrison in East Pakistan consisting of the 14th Division. This force is based from the Dacca cantonment but is currently under siege by rioting Bengali protestors opposed to the coup launched by the military. In West Pakistan, the military has calculated its options are limited as an airlift of reinforcements is not feasible. The rebels in Dacca seized the East Pakistan Assembly and are proclaiming their succession from Pakistan, claiming the independence of Bangladesh. The only other forces are locally raised East Pakistan Rifles who have largely defected and have taken their West Pakistani colleagues as prisoners. The rebel forces stated they will allow all Pakistani military personnel to leave the country, if the government promises not to engage in armed conflict. The commander of the 14th notes his forces are desperately short of equipment but will fight if ordered by the government, despite their families being with them in the cantonment."
 Bangladesh_Independence.3.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced that it would not risk the lives of its soldiers on a hopeless display or risk the loss of innocent civilians who would be caught in the crossfire. President Ayub Khan noted that an airlift was already underway, with aircraft from several friendly states arriving to Dacca to help the transportation of the 14th Division, West Pakistani military personnel with the East Pakistan Rifles, and loyal government employees back to West Pakistan. He stated the government views Bangladesh as a rebellious territory but states it will seek talks in the future to eventually reunite the country. Many in West Pakistan are happy to see the violence end and the troops return, but there is a deep sense of anger brewing. Many argue an independent Bangladesh threatens the basis of the existence of Pakistan and many on the left note this dramatic transformation would not have occurred had the military stayed in its barracks."
 Bangladesh_Independence.4.d:0 "The Pakistan government ordered the 14th Division to hold out till the end for the honor of their country and then rejected the demands from the so-called Bangladeshi government. Within hours rebel fighters, bolstered by the arrival of defecting Pakistani units, engaged in street to street fighting around the cantonment. The Pakistani forces held on for several days before running out of ammunition and were soon overwhelmed. Both sides took heavy military casualties but also civilian casualties as residential areas became battlegrounds. In the chaos the families of military personnel living in the cantonments also took losses due to the fighting and its aftermath. The surviving military personnel and the military families are being held in detention. The Bangladeshi government passed a resolution honoring the heroic sacrifices of their people against the Pakistani state and noted Pakistan send thousands into combat for no reasonable purpose. Internationally the Pakistani action is being strongly condemned but domestically, the people are rallying behind the government and their martyrs."

 PAK_ECON.1.d:0 "At independence Pakistan inherited one of the largest jute producing regions of the world in East Pakistan and major cotton producing areas in West Pakistan. The government has development funds and must decide on whether to use those funds to build cotton processing facilities in West Pakistan or jute processing facilities in East Pakistan. Some officials note such an investment will help make Pakistani cotton more competitive on the global market. While others argue that the jute industry has great potential, but partition left many of their processing facilities in Indian Bengal. Putting these facilities in East Pakistan will help restore the jute industry and allow it to thrive."
 PAK_ECON.2.d:0 "One of the pressing issues facing Pakistan at independence was the lack of banks and finance available to the new nation. The establishment of the National Bank of Pakistan has helped alleviate the commercial banking demand. It opened its first branch in East Pakistan to help the jute industry. Now the bank is looking to expand and open new branches. One group of officials believe the bank should open up more locations in Karachi the rapidly growing capital of the country. Others argue that the success in East Pakistan should be expanded and more branches will lead to more growth for the province."
 PAK_ECON.4.d:0 "The colonial British had long neglected the North West Frontier Province NWFP due to its difficult conditions and role in the Anglo-Afghan Wars. The federal budget has some extra surplus cash that can be spent on improving roads in the province. However, an alternative option is available in East Pakistan, where in the interior there is also a shortage of roads and infrastructure improvements. While what is today East Pakistan did provide extensive raw materials during the colonial period, much of the infrastructure investment went to what is now Indian Bengal. Using that surplus to improve the infrastructure in East Pakistan maybe more useful than investing in the NWFP."
 PAK_ECON.3.d:0 "The Finance Minister informs us that two growing corporations are interested in receiving extensive credit from the national bank to support an expansion into the steel manufacturing market. One is the Lahore based Mughal Traders company. They originally were iron and steel importers but want to establish their own production facilities. The other company which has applied for an expansion is BSRM. This company already has a small steel mill but with to expand and modernize their equipment to ramp up production. Both companies have sound proposals but we can only afford to support the expansion of one."
 PAK_ECON.5.d:0 "Since independence, both Karachi and Chittagong have risen in prominence. Both are vital ports for the country. In addition, both have seen an influx in refugees trying to find a new life in Pakistan. The cabinet has recently received development funding requests from the two cities. Both would like to expand their ports and incentivize industrial development to offer employment for newly arrived residents. As our country is still growing and does not come from immense wealth, it is up to the cabinet to decide who receives this development. Supporters for Chittagong argue it deserves more development as Dacca reaps the most resources. Karachi backers note that since the city is the federal capital, the government should support efforts to make it more developed and appealing to not just the people but international visitors as well."

 INDIA_PAK_COM.1.d:0 "The Communist Party of Pakistan CPP formed months after independence during the 2nd All-India Conference of the Communist Party of India. Over the next few weeks, in Dacca, the ruling CPP will host its first All-India Party Conference with representatives from the Indian Communist Party. The two parties have already announced they will work closely together and renew their shared history. However, the conference will also discuss three major issues. One is whether Pakistan should begin the process of being a base for the export of revolution into India or its neighbors. The second is whether Pakistan will open its borders and allow Indian communist activists and workers to come and help the country. Finally, the question of nationalism and Bengal will also be decided."
 Bengal_Question.1.d:0 "The Bengali delegates of both the Indian Communist Party and the Communist Party of Pakistan CPP sit together and often vote together throughout the conference. This powerful voting block has brought to the discussion the idea of respecting national sovereignty and argue the revolution can be more effectively implemented if East Pakistan is allowed total autonomy. A Socialist Republic of Bangladesh would be able to directly mobilize workers and peasants as they are more advanced in their class consciousness than in West Pakistan. Finally, they could also help speak to and mobilize the Indian Bengali working class. The CPP leadership has carefully considered this proposal and there is a lot of support for the proposal. However, there are many who fear that dividing the country will alienate the reactionary and anti-revolutionary classes in Pakistan who will try to exploit such a move as a sign of weakness. This will be the last topic for the conference to decide on."

 Ayub_Khan.1.d:0 "General Ayub Khan, the Chief Martial Law Administrator announced that Iskander Mirza and resigned from office and had transferred his powers to him. The General announced he would take the title of President, promote himself to Field Marshal and step down as the Army Chief. The new Army Chief will be General Muhammad Musa. President Ayub Khan promised that the military intervention will last only until the nation has a system of government which will act in the interest of all citizens and not be vulnerable to the corruption and dirty politics of the last decade. Many in Pakistan are applauding the new President as they saw Mirza as a part of the old political class. His resignation and flight to London is being seen by observers as evidence that Ayub Khan has won the struggle for leadership in Pakistan."
 Ayub_Khan.2.d:0 "President Ayub Khan in recent weeks has been holding meetings with senior bureaucrats, civil service officers, and judicial officials. He noted that since independence it has been them and the military who have kept the Pakistani state functioning as politicians constantly wrangled and worked to overthrow one another, leading to inefficiency in political leadership. The President called on these groups to work with him and ensure the Pakistani people have more effective government and that the administration of the country is not negatively impacted by the Martial Law regime. He noted the military has little knowledge on governance and their support will be vital. These senior officials were very receptive to the President and it appears a nexus of a military-civil service alliance is being formed to run the country."
 
 Gilgit.1.d:0 "The government of Pakistan confirmed it had taken over direct administration over Gilgit-Balistan and the Azad Kashmiri government agreed to hand over administration. The reason for this is that Gilgit-Balistan is that the more populous Gilgit region is not directly linked to Azad Kashmir. More importantly, during the Kashmir War it was the Gilgit Scouts, led by Major William Brown, and the people of the area who liberated themselves from the Kashmiri government, they pledged their loyalty not to a new independent Kashmir but to Pakistan. The Indian government has condemned this announcement and claim we are annexing Gilgit-Balistan from historical Kashmir to ensure in a future peace deal we do not risk losing those lands. Our government has dismissed the Indian suggestion as ludicrous."
 USA_PAK.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister of Pakistan recently concluded an extensive state visit to the United States. The high-power trip saw the Prime Minister arrive with senior cabinet ministers. During the trip the ministers met with their counterparts while the Prime Minister held extensive talks with the President. The Prime Minister also addressed Congress, informing them of the aspirations and early struggles of Pakistan. He toured major landmarks and at the Pentagon he emphasized his desire to see Pakistan armed to deal with any threat, especially communism. The visit ended with a glamourous state dinner and before the Prime Minister left, he invited the American President to visit Pakistan soon. The American media was quite impressed with the Prime Minister while the media in Pakistan noted, with pride, the impressive protocol afforded their leader. The American President promised to help address the agricultural shortages facing Pakistan."
 
 Rawalpindi.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister recently learned of a plot against the government involving military officers and senior leftists by the Army Chief. The information comes from one of the alleged plotters who reported he had attended a party in which he saw prominent leftists present with at least one senior general. He stated they made statements disparaging the current leadership for not mobilizing the population and invading Kashmir as soon as possible. The officer added he believed they were discussing how positive it would be for the Army to establish a new, leftist government, but stated he did not hear any concrete planning. The Army Chief has asked the Prime Minister if he would like to act and arrest the conspirators or leave them be. Although arresting the conspirators would root out the threat, some advisors suggest the information received is scant and making the arrests may end up making the government look weak and embarrass the military."
 Rawalpindi.2.d:0 "The nation was stunned today as newspapers published a press release from the Prime Minister in which he revealed the arrest of fifteen military officers and prominent leftist activists, including members of the Communist Party of Pakistan over a plot to overthrow the government. The statement noted that General Akbar Khan sought to violently overthrow the government and install a communist regime in order to launch a campaign of internal repression and war. The arrested officers include several colonels and majors while famed poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was among the leftists arrested. All the conspirators will be swiftly tried and brought to justice. Many in Pakistan applaud the swift action by the Prime Minister to sweep up this Rawalpindi Conspiracy. However, critics note the lack of evidence presented in the statement and some are suggesting the Army itself may not be trustworthy."
 Rawalpindi.3.d:0 "Highly organized communist cadres in Dacca and Karachi simultaneously stormed government buildings this morning. They took many politicians and officials hostage and when the Prime Minister called the military headquarters to demand action. However, upon calling he discovered most senior commanders were being detained and communist sympathizing senior officers had taken over GHQ. With GHQ under their control, the coup leaders ordered local military units not to intervene against the communist cadres and soon the government had capitulated to the coup led by General Akbar Khan. Over the previous years, a conspiracy involving military officers and leading leftists saw sympathetic officers be shifted to strategic positions and the mobilization of communist cadres to act at the right moment. General Akbar Khan has so far minimized the possibility of a counter-coup by detaining the senior generals and by his reputation as the famed commander of freedom fighters during the Kashmir War."
 Rawalpindi.4.d:0 "The recent coup saw an alliance of leftist activists, disgruntled military officers, and the Communist Party of Pakistan CPP act in coordination to seize power. In a recent party meeting, the CPP has announced the appointment of famed poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz as the new leader of Pakistan. He has a strong following and leftist credentials due to his poetry while his background as a former military officer makes him acceptable to many of the leftist officers. He will coordinate efforts by the party to unite the factions and begin the process of transforming Pakistan and ending inequality. General Akbar Khan, who led the military officers and Sajjad Zaheer, the former head of the CPP both recognize they lack the national appeal of Faiz Ahmed Faiz but are expected to rule closely with him and were given senior positions."

 PAK_ASSASIN.2.d:0 "In a stunning tragedy, beloved Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan was gunned down in Rawalpindi today. He was addressing citizens at a park when the gunman struck. Police officers immediately returned fire, killing the assassin. The assassin was identified as Said Khan, an Afghan national. The government are investigating his motives, but it appears this was the act of a disturbed individual and not a conspiracy, though many in the country suspect an Afghan plot. The nation is already said to be in mourning with messages of sympathy arriving from neighboring sates and leading politicians in both Pakistan and India. Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan leaves behind a wife and three children."
 PAK_ASSASIN.1.d:0 "The assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan has plunged Pakistan into mourning but also a palpable sense of uncertainty. Prime Minister Ali Khan had guided Pakistan through the difficult early years of independence, and he was seen as the only leader capable of guiding the Constituent Assembly on its difficult mission to create a constitution. For the Muslim League, the loss of Liaquat Ali Khan has led to renewed fears the party may collapse. Ali Khan masterfully kept the many groups attached to the party unified and it remains to be seen if the party will endure without him. The Prime Minister post now needs a new leader and members of the Constituent Assembly are struggling to come up with a leader who has national legitimacy. Many are calling on the Governor General to stepdown and take over as no one in the assembly appears capable. To the people of Pakistan, Liaquat Ali Khan has become the Shaheed-e-Millat, Martyr of the Nation."

 PAK_Constitution.0.d:0 "Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan commissioned Khawaja Nazimuddin to establish a committee to determine the underlying principles that would determine the future constitution. The report was recently released. The report argued only Urdu would be the national language and proposed a legislature that split the seats evenly with West and East Pakistan. It also called on creating a ulema council to study all laws and confirm they conformed to Islam. The report has seen a huge backlash in the press, especially from minorities and Bengalis in East Pakistan. Minorities find the ulema council to be problematic. Bengalis have criticized the language provision and equal seats, noting that equaling the representation of both wings was undemocratic and ignored the fact that East Pakistan had a larger population. Upon hearing this backlash, Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan asked the committee to reconvene and resubmit the form later."
 PAK_Constitution.1.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The government declared an end to all colonial era laws and regulations which had been governing the country as it worked on making the constitution. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It would be a parliamentary system with only one house, called the National Assembly. East and West Pakistan will each have an equal number of representatives. The President will be ceremonial but possess emergency powers if needed and the national languages will be Urdu, English, and Bengali. The government is being praised for its efforts as it worked closely with the opposition to pass finalize the document. Governor-General Iskandar Mirza will become President. Although the constitution is being well-received there are some concerns over the Presidential emergency powers and the provisions giving the Center a free reign to interfere in provincial government matters."
 PAK_Constitution.2.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ending the last visages of colonialism. It would be a parliamentary system, with two houses. Although the seats will be divided proportionally to population, giving East Pakistan more seats, the constitution has provisions for reserved seats which when added together creates parity. The constitution is very similar to the Bogra formula and emphasizes the importance of an independent judiciary. The country will have three national languages, Bengali, Urdu, and English and provincial rights are guaranteed by the parliament. However, the President, though largely ceremonial does have certain emergency powers to remove provincial and federal governments. It is believed this was added to ensure the Governor-General and future President Iskandar Mirza approved the document."
 PAK_Constitution.3.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has officially approved the first constitution for Pakistan. The new constitution ends dominion status and declares the state will be called the Islamic Nation of Pakistan. The new constitution envisions a two-house parliament, one made up exclusively of Muslim men of character. The other consisting of ulema from across the country. The constitution defined Muslims as those who believe the finality of the prophet and declared the Sharia Court to be the highest court in the country. The head of state will be the Sadar-e-Mumlikat meaning head of state and this office will be held by the current Governor-General, Iskandar Mirza. In the future, this position will be elected by the two houses form among its members. This position also possesses emergency powers, which some suggest was the cost demanded by Mirza before he approved the constitution. The reaction among the elites, minorities, and those connected to the government has been pure horror over the new constitution."

 PAEC.1.d:0 "The government confirmed the establishment of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission PAEC. This is the culmination to the decision by Pakistan to engage in the Atoms for Peace program of the United States. The independent body brings together the leading nuclear and physics scientists of Pakistan origin who will work to develop nuclear energy as a solution to the growing demand for energy. The first chairman will be the highly respected experimental physicist Dr. Nazir Ahmed. The PAEC announced it has no intentions of engaging in weapons research and hopes to utilize this new technology for the benefit of the Pakistani people. The United States notes Pakistan has shown a keen interest in this energy technology form the beginning and looks forward to helping the country achieve its energy needs. Scholarships and funding for young Pakistani scientists will be distributed by the PAEC to build the knowledge base necessary for a peaceful nuclear program."
 PAK_INDIA.10.d:0 "The Indian government recently offered a no war pact with Pakistan. This was, as the Pakistani government assumes, meant to embarrass them internationally and try to portray Pakistan as a nation itching for war. In response to their offer, Pakistan gave a press conference and noted that they "would love nothing more than to have peaceful relations with India and dreams of both nations working side by side for the security of South Asia". However, they say "that India is well aware that an agreement to this treaty cannot be reached as long as the festering wound of Kashmir remains". They continued with saying that "if the Indian government implements the UN resolutions and works to resolve the issue in a way that recognizes the wishes of Kashmiris, then certainly a no war pact would be reasonable, but given the present circumstances, such a pact is impossible to seriously consider"."
 Afghan_PAK.20.d:0 "Since the independence of Pakistan, Afghanistan has constantly challenged us internationally. Afghanistan voted against our entrance to the United Nations are said to be trying to stir up tribal uprisings against our government. This dates back to the British period when Afghanistan claimed the Pathans residing in our lands belong to them. Now the Afghans claim their treaties with the British no longer apply and they have claim to our western territories with Pathan populations. Considering the tensions with India, many in the government feel continued conflict with Afghanistan only hurts us. However, others suggest having a hardline, tough approach to the Afghans will ensure they do not try and stab us in the back. We control their access to international goods, we can threaten them about it."
 Gwadar.1.d:0 "The port of Gwadar has long been under the administration of the Omani Sultan. His claim to the port were secured by agreements with the British and the neighboring Princely State of Makran, who previously controlled the port. After Pakistan gained independence, Makran joined the country but Gwadar remained under Omani rule. Recently, the Pakistani government approached the Omani government and after friendly negotiations, the Omanis have agreed to return Gwadar to Pakistan under a sale of purchase. The agreement shows how Muslim brothers can work together to work in the interests of the people and is a contrast to the Indians who often utilize brute force when dealing with land claims. With Gwadar secure, West Pakistan now has a second deep water port it can develop in the future."
 Khan_PAK.1.d:0 "The Pakistani Foreign Minister, Zafarullah Khan has proven to be an amazing asset for our government. Since independence he has not only eloquently defended our government, but he helped push key UN resolutions over Kashmir that demanded their right of self-determination be preserved. In those early debates on Kashmir he constantly outmaneuvered his Indian opponents and made sure no power vetoed the resolutions passed. He also played a major role in aiding UN discussions during the Palestine Partition and has strengthened our ties with the United States by openly condemning communist aggression internationally. He remains a thorn to the Indian propaganda effort over Kashmir and is viewed as a great spokesman for Kashmir at home and an esteemed statesman abroad."

 Lahore_Riots.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin has received an ultimatum from an alliance of ulema called the Majlis-i-Amal. The ultimatum calls for the removal of Ahmadis from government offices and the declaration that Ahmadis are non-Muslim. The conflict is over the belief by many mainstream Muslim communities that the Ahmadis, who claim to be a Muslim sect, are not Muslims as they do not believe in the finality of the prophet. Although the Prime Minister is a conservative with a strong religious belief, he is a strict constitutionalist and has rejected the ultimatum. Unfortunately, this decision has led to riots erupting in Lahore where supporters of the Majlis-i-Amal are ransacking, looting, and destroying the homes, businesses, and houses of worship of the Ahmadis living there. The police are said to be joining the rioters and now the Prime Minister must call martial law and deploy the troops."
 Lahore_Riots.2.d:0 "The anti-Ahmadi riots which engulfed the city weeks earlier has largely come to an end. After the Prime Minister deployed the Pakistan Army to restore order and implement martial law, the citizens of the country were excited by how quickly the Army succeeded. Within hours of entering the city, violence began to decline as troops strictly imposed curfew. Unlike the police, military discipline held, and none joined the protestors. Martial law remains in place but life in the city is returning to normal. The main imams involved in the protests were sentenced to death by military courts, though many suspect the sentences will be commuted to life terms. The people of Lahore report friendly interactions with the Army. A beautification program launched by the Army has some residents joking the military is leaving Lahore nicer than before the riots. Some in Pakistan now wonder if the boys in khaki offer more stability than the politicians in Karachi."
 PAK_1955.1.d:0 "The Constituent Assembly has reconvened after its dismissal by the Governor-General. The new assembly consists of three factions, the Triple Alliance, which combines the divided conservative faction that has governed the country since partition. The United Front also has supporters in the assembly, they consist of leftists, many from East Pakistan who were recently galvanized over the language debate. They also benefit from the perception that East Pakistanis are being undermined by the establishment. Finally, there is the Jamaat-i-Islami, the main Islamist party in the country. The Jamaat continues to struggle politically due to its opposition over the creation of Pakistan but still has an impressive network of grassroots networks across the country. The Governor-General must decide whether to keep the Triple Alliance in power, go with the popular but dangerous United Front, or let the Jamaat-i-Islami take power."
 Ahmedi.1.d:0 "The parliament recently passed a new bill which it claimed solves the Ahmadi Question permanently. The bill declares Ahmadis to be non-Muslim as they do not meet the constitutional requirements of what a Muslim is and releases all those convicted of involvement in the recent Lahore Riots. The bill notes those Muslims who participated were driven by passion and a desire to protect the faith and cannot be punished for doing the will of God. The bill bans Ahmadis from being buried in Muslim cemeteries or from calling their houses of worship mosques. News of the bill has already seen many Ahmadi businesses shutdown and houses go for sale. Western embassies are being bombarded with applications for asylum and one of the largest business communities in Lahore appears to be leaving the country in droves."
 PAK_REl.1.d:0 "The Jamaat-i-Islami government announced it would expand the number of imams on bases and within military units. In addition, it noted the Chaplain Corps will be renamed the Imam Corps as they expect to announce the removal of non-Muslims from the armed forces in the next few years. The increase in imams is meant to improve the morale of the fighting men and the imams will have a higher rank than previously. They will also observe and ensure rules of the faith are being observed. Although the military did not respond to this announcement, many believe the military is furious at this intervention into its structure and discipline. Many officers note their forces are already motivated by patriotism and religious fervor to defend the country and the government clearly does not trust them."

 PAK_Afghan_Relations.1.d:0 "Afghanistan has always threatened the unity of our nation. Since independence they constantly stir up Pathan nationalism through their Pashtunistan campaign. In addition, they have continuously refused to recognize our border along the Durand Line. Over the years we suspect they have not only been spreading propaganda but also engaged in clandestine and overt efforts to stir an armed uprising. So far our forces have remained vigilant to the threat. However, the status quo is no longer acceptable, especially as we have other security concerns to deal with. We have two options on Afghanistan. We can either open a dialogue and strengthen bilateral relations, or we can respond to Afghan aggression with our own hardline and force them to the peace table."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.2.d:0 "The Pakistani government has invited us for talks in Peshawar. From media reports and discussions with their ambassadors, it is clear the Pakistanis are seeking to hold an olive branch to us. Although there are some hardliners who advocate we reject the talks as long as Pashtunistan is not on the agenda, doing so will likely alienate non-Pushtoon leaders in the country. They are increasingly criticizing our government for what it calls an obsession with Pashtunistan which has cost the nation dearly in terms of trade. We will send a delegation but the highest-ranking member of it will be the Foreign Minister, this way we can keep both the hardliners and moderates happy. The hardliners will like the idea of not sending more senior officials, while the moderates welcome the possibility of peace talks. The talks will take place in a week."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.3.d:0 "The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan arrived in Peshawar to hold talks with senior Pakistani leaders over the outstanding issues between both states. The Pakistani government gave the visiting Afghans a large reception and provided tours for the first few days, including a tour of the famed Bala Hissar Fort. This visit did result in a small gaffe as the Afghan media criticized the Foreign Minister for visiting the former royal residence of the Afghan monarchy that is now headquarters to what Afghanistan terms an occupying military force. Despite these minor issues, the talks have now started and the Pakistani government has not hidden its hopes that a breakthrough can be reached."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.4.d:0 "The Pakistani government noted that it considers the Durand Line to be the official border of both nations, despite the criticism of Afghanistan. However, it also noted that at independence, Pakistan made it a point to withdraw permanent military outposts from the Tribal Areas to respect the autonomy of its tribes. The Pakistanis state this demonstrates their desire for peace in the region and respect for the peoples living on the border. In fact the Pakistanis have offered to further loosen border restrictions on the border to allow Afghan and Pakistani families separated at the border to more easily travel to one another. On the surface the proposal appears very sound and would benefit Afghan families. Signing the agreement appears very beneficial, especially if we want peace eventually. However, some in Kabul worry the proposal is a steppingstone for the Pakistanis to lull Afghanistan and eventually have us accept the Durand Line."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.5.d:0 "The Foreign Minister of Afghanistan informed the Pakistani government that the proposal on looser borders was unacceptable. The Minister insists the only solution to the crisis is the removal of Pakistani forces from Pashtunistan and a referendum for the people to decide. With no progress in sight, the talks were quickly concluded. Many in Pakistan are disappointed over the failed talks, with some opposition leaders openly criticizing the President for his failure in resolving tensions with Afghanistan. Regardless, the government feels it had to try and hopes in time the Afghan government can see reason. In Kabul the hardliners praised the government for its firm stance, while moderates voiced criticism over the inflexibility shown during the negotiations."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.6.d:0 "In Peshawar, representatives of the Pakistani and Afghan government signed an agreement to loosen border restrictions in order to facilitate travel between families that are separated by the border. For Afghanistan, the agreement will provide relief to many of its citizens who have bitterly criticized border restrictions for years. In Pakistan, the agreement is seen as an act of political maturity from the government and an indication of its desire to have peaceful relations with Afghanistan. However, there are some critics to the agreement. Hardliners in Kabul accuse the government of betraying the sacred pledge for Pashtunistan while in Pakistan some have expressed concern that more open borders could lead to Afghan infiltration in the country. Regardless, the majority of people in both nations appear satisfied with the agreement."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.100.d:0 "Following our successful agreement with Afghanistan on looser borders, relations are positive and we are in a good position diplomatically. Some officials believe now is the time to offer a referendum on Pashtunistan for the people of the Tribal Areas, not the North-West Frontier Province or areas of Baluchistan. Although the Afghans argue the referendum should be done by a neutral party, we can simply say that as no military outposts are present in the Tribal Areas, there can be no fear of intimidation. We will even offer to sign a binding agreement with Afghanistan to respect the results. At the very least Afghanistan will appreciate the gesture, and if they accept, we are confident the Tribal Areas will remain in Pakistan."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.7.d:0 "In an extraordinary proposal, the Pakistani government has offered to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan. However, there are some caveats, they have limited only to the Tribal Areas and will administer the referendum themselves. This proposal shows at the very least a desire from the Pakistanis to listen and can be appreciated. Indeed, moderates and some hardliners within the government urge us to accept the proposal. If the Tribal Areas vote to join Afghanistan, it very well may lead to public pressure in Pakistan to expand the referendum to the NWFP and Baluchistan. Many hardliners and some moderates however, disagree. They see the offer as disengenous and a ploy to try and weaken our position on the issue. They insist Pakistan would not accept the vote unless they knew they could win. Instead they argue we should at the very least accept the gesture in good faith, but decline as it does not cover all of Pashtunistan."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.8.d:0 "Kabul informed our Foreign Minister they have accepted the offer to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan in the Tribal Areas. We have already sent out an announcement on the vote which will take place in about 90 days. The reaction in Afghanistan is mixed, with some calling it the first step to liberation while others arguing it is a Pakistani ploy. Preparations are already beginning as we dispatched instructions to Political Agents in the Tribal Areas to mobilize support among tribal leaders. In addition, intelligence resources are also being sent in to monitor how people plan to vote and ensure the pro-Pakistani numbers increase."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.9.d:0 "The Afghan government informed us they did not approve of the proposal to hold a referendum on Pashtunistan in the Tribal Areas. Afghanistan would want such a vote to incorporate all of Pashtunistan and ideally be conducted through a neutral third party. Regardless, Afghanistan did mention they appreciated the gesture as a positive movement and hoped we would soon accept the need for a comprehensive referendum in the future. Although our proposal was rejected, we did improve relations as our offer caused further divisions within the hardliner faction in Kabul, which only strengthens the position of those pushing for peace."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.10.d:0 "The long-awaited results from a recent referendum in the Pakistan Tribal Areas on whether its people wished to join Afghanistan as part of Pashtunistan or remain in Pakistan arrived yesterday. The people voted to stay in Pakistan. The Pakistan government praised the tribal people for their dedication and devotion to the nation. The result comes amid accusations that Pakistani officials offered incentives for tribal leaders to endorse voting for Pakistan and reports that residents who travelled between Pakistan and Afghanistan were considered ineligible to vote. Perhaps the biggest criticism was the arrival of many ballots from Pathans in the armed forces who claimed to be from the Tribal Areas. Pakistan is satisfied with the vote and its government claims it had never doubted the loyalty of its people. The reaction from Afghanistan will likely come soon."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.11.d:0 "Kabul released a blistering statement condemning the recent referendum held in the Pakistan Tribal Areas over if the residents wished to remain in Pakistan or join Afghanistan for Pashtunistan. A large majority voted to remain in Pakistan. However, the Afghan government contends widespread voter manipulation occurred in the weeks leading up to the vote. In addition the Pakistanis refused to count the votes of those who regularly traveled across the border, claiming it was unknown if they were permanent residents of the Pakistani Tribal Areas. With these issues, the Afghan government insists the results were illegitimate and they would not stop championing the cause of Pashtunistan for the millions of Pathans struggling under Pakistani occupation."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.12.d:0 "The Pakistan government, in an unusually scathing statement, denounced the government of Afghanistan for its constant interference in Pakistani affairs. They accuse the Afghans of seeking to start armed uprisings and spreading false claims in order to poison the relationship of Pakistan to its citizens along the border. The government noted it had its own capabilities and if the Afghans did not relent, Pakistan would soon have to bring them in line to teach them a lesson. It is clear that Pakistan is nearing a breaking point with Afghanistan."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.13.d:0 "Continuing its recent shift towards hostility, the Pakistan government demanded Afghanistan recognize the Durand Line as the official border between both nations. The Pakistanis insisted Afghans stop living in a fanciful world and accept the reality on the ground. It noted Afghanistan accepted the border under the Raj and as Pakistan inherited those lands, it had to respect the border. This is an aggressive push by Pakistan and some fear they maybe looking at military options. Some in the government suggest we privately assure the Pakistanis we harbor no ambitions for their territory, but that we cannot publicly recognize the border at this moment. The hardliners in the government insist we denounce the Pakistani government for its bullying and reiterate our stance."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.14.d:0 "The Afghan government dispatched an intermediary to inform our government that Afghanistan has heard our warnings. The intermediary insisted Afghanistan currently has no plots or desires to change the status quo along the border. They have also promised to tone down some of the Pashtunistan propaganda and will endeavor to keep relations as cordial as possible. In exchange they have asked us to reign in the hostile commentary and keep channels open. Our government will accept this statement and soon tone down the rhetoric, we have achieved our objective of using a strong posture to push the Afghans towards peace."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.15.d:0 "The Afghan government defiantly condemned our recent statements and reiterated their claims to Pashtunistan. The Afghan government insists it is on a pure and noble mission and they will not be browbeaten by any foreign power. It appears our hardline approach has not led the Afghans to realize their constant hostility benefits no one. Indeed, relations have only worsened, and we must remain vigilant on the western border. The Pakistan Army however, has a proposal on how to firmly show Afghanistan the seriousness of our position and save the situation to our favor."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Border_War:0 "Start Border War with Afghanistan"
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Border_War_desc.d:0 "The Afghan government continues to bring up Pashtunistan and threatens the stability of Pakistan. A bold plan from GHQ calls for our forces to engage in a border conflict with the Afghans. Once we defeat the Afghan forces on the border, their government will realize the gravity of the situation and come to their senses."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.16.d:0 "The recent border war between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended in a victory for Pakistani forces. Pakistani forces recently launched operations against Afghan forces on the border. Many analysts thought the Pakistanis would have the upper hand in the conflict and they were proved right. News of the military defeat on the border led to panic in Kabul as some feared the Pakistani forces may push deeper into the country. However, the Pakistani government instead halted, claiming its forces had delivered a befitting reply to years of Afghan harassment. Sources in Kabul indicate the Pakistanis managed to extract a promise of non-aggression from the Afghan government for at least five years. The Pakistan Army is enjoying public demonstrations in its honor across major Pakistani cities in appreciation for its successful operations."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations.17.d:0 "The recent border war between Pakistan and Afghanistan ended in victory for the Afghan Army. Pakistani forces had started the fighting after launching attacks on Afghan troops on the border. Many analysts thought the Pakistanis would have the upper hand, but this proved a faulty assumption. The details are not clear, but it appears the Pakistan military had either underestimated the Afghans or overestimated themselves. Afghan forces not only drove back the Pakistanis but are currently occupying some territory over the border, calling it liberated land of Pashtunistan. With warnings from Delhi, the Pakistan government is incapable of expanding the conflict and must live with the stinging consequences of this failed campaign. In Kabul there is a feeling of joy and optimism that the dream of Pashtunistan is far from a fantasy."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.1.d:0 "The Pakistani Ambassador delivered a message from President Ayub Khan inviting a delegation to hold talks in Pakistan. The message was friendly and it appears the Pakistanis are looking to mend ties. However, we cannot let them lull us into a position where we abandon our brothers across the border. Some of the advisors suggest we reject the invitation as words cannot solve our problems. However, others argue we should accept the invitation, to at least see their stance and maybe improve conditions on the border to our advantage."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.2.d:0 "Our efforts at reaching out to Afghanistan bore fruit as they have agreed to send a high-level delegation to hold talks with us. We can expect their arrival shortly and must consider the approach we wish to take for the talks. For President Ayub, an ethnic Pathan, he is keenly interested in stabilizing ties with Afghanistan and prevent unrest among the Pakistani Pathan population. If such a scenario occurred it could prove disastrous, especially with regards to ties with India. We can take a conciliatory approach and sign agreements to boost ties and cultural exchanges. Or we can take a hardline and call for Afghanistan to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.3.d:0 "During talks held with the Pakistanis, they have offered a series of measures, including cultural exchanges that are meant to improve ties. The Pakistani offer is no doubt meant to normalize ties between our states. Increasing cultural ties would afford us to gain more intelligence and would reduce some of the tension in Kabul. However, accepting the initiative may confuse our own people and reduce their fervor for the Pashtunistan cause. We must decide what move would be best."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.4.d:0 "In a jarring meeting with the Pakistanis, they have stated their desire for us to accept the Durand Line as the permanent border. As this stands against the key pillar of our foreign policy, our delegation immediately refused. It appeared the talks were about to end abruptly, however, the Pakistanis offered a compromise. They stated if we could give private assurances that we can accept the Durand Line that would be enough for them. We can accept this compromise, or reject it outright and end the talks."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.5.d:0 "President Ayub received news that the Afghan government has rebuffed our invitation to hold talks. This is a troubling developments and indicates they are bent on trying to change the status quo. The Afghans are no doubt harboring dangerous designs and we must remain vigilant on the border. Regardless, the military insists the Afghan threat is minimal and can be easily monitored or contained. President Ayub will have to accept this effort has failed."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.6.d:0 "The Afghans proved very receptive to our proposals on normalizing ties and have accepted. They only asked for minor adjustments meant to improve travel for Afghans with relatives in Pakistan. President Ayub enthusiastically signed the agreements and released a statement celebrating what he termed the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Afghan government released its own, more muted statement approving of the agreement, stating it will help facilitate the reunion of Afghans with their families across the border."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.7.d:0 "The Afghan delegation stated they could not in good conscious accept our generous proposals for normalizing ties. They insisted as long as we continued to deny Pathans the right for Pashtunistan, they could not attempt to mend ties. We informed them that there was nothing left to discuss then. The talks thus concluded and the Afghans returned to Kabul. We released a statement expressing our disappointment with the failure to achieve a breakthrough. The Afghans released their own statement accusing us of using the talks as a means to gain a propaganda victory. President Ayub is bitterly disappointed with the outcome."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.8.d:0 "The Afghan delegation reiterated that the Durand Line was not on the table. They added that there did not appear to be anything left to discuss and abruptly ended the talks to return home. For President Ayub Khan this marks a major setback in his efforts to establish a calm western border. The Pakistani government released a statement regretting the talks could not achieve a meaningful breakthrough. The Afghan government released its own terse statement accusing Pakistan of using the talks as means to permanently deny the right of Pashtunistan to the Pathan people."
 PAK_Afghan_Relations_Alt.9.d:0 "The Afghan delegation returned and stated that they were willing to give private assurances regarding the Durand Line. They stated they will for the near future not bring up the Durand Line or make it into a major sticking point. President Ayub is very satisfied with this development. The Afghan delegation soon returned back to Kabul. The Pakistani government released a statement calling the talks a positive step and would hopefully lead to a future of positive ties. The Afghan government released its own statement saying it was satisfied with the results of the talks."


 PAK_Dissolve_One_Unit_desc:0 "The One Unit created an artificial and large government structure. It also erased the individual identities of our diverse population. The policy proved unpopular, especially for government employees who were being stationed in areas far from their homes. The original four provinces of West Pakistan are now restored."
 PAK_Expand_Provincial_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "The previous regime overly centralized power to the President and federal services. This over centralization slowed development and effective governance on the local level. With the provinces restored, provincial civil servants will be appointed in much larger numbers."
 PAK_Reduce_Federal_Authority_desc:0 "The government announced a new initiative that curtails federal involvement or reach into the provincial affairs of the provinces. The people of Pakistan must trust their local authorities and operate without fear of any federal interventions."
 PAK_Launch_Anti_Pashtunistan_Campaign_desc:0 "The Afghan government has advocated for the formation of Pashtunistan for decades. They use the cause to raise unrest among our own Pathan population and to rally popular support in Afghanistan. Working with local officials, an anti-Pashtunistan campaign will be launched. We will use the news media and radio broadcasts to battle the Afghan propaganda."
 PAK_Afghan_Indian_Relations_desc:0 "President Fatima Jinnah heavily criticized Ayub Khan for being too soft with India. She also agreed to allow the military to take the lead on regional issues. She plans to challenge India diplomatically and allow the military to take a hardline with Afghanistan."
 PAK_Denounce_Indian_Stubborness_desc:0 "In a press conference with the international press, President Fatima Jinnah condemned the Indian government for their refusal to engage in a meaningful dialogue. She insisted India remains the only impediment to peace for South Asia."
 PAK_Military_Insists_On_Hardline_desc:0 "The Pakistan military reports the regional security situation remains highly tense. The Indians continue to increase their troop presence on the border. Afghanistan remains a potent threat. Its government continues to enflame its population with its ridiculous call for Pashtunistan. Pakistan must prepare for the worst."
 PAK_Express_Solidarity_With_Kashmir_At_UN_desc:0 "The Pakistan government initiated a major diplomatic campaign at the United Nations. They are arguing the Kashmiri people remain victims of Indian political games. The effort has found support among sympathetic powers, and the Pakistan permanent representative noted that just raising awareness is a major victory."
 PAK_New_Afghan_Border_Posts_desc:0 "The Pakistan Army announced the establishment of new border posts and the deployment of more paramilitary forces patrolling the area. The trans-frontier tribes, which regularly move back and forth from the border will be heavily restricted by this move. The Afghan government heavily criticized the action."
 PAK_Adopt_Universal_Suffrage_desc:0 "After a brief debate, the National Assembly passed several constitutional amendments establishing universal suffrage. The previous indirect election system through basic democrats has been abolished. The new amendments are being widely praised as many Pakistanis welcome a return to democratic rights."
 PAK_Transform_To_Parliamentary_System_desc:0 "The National Assembly finally passed a series of amendments turning Pakistan into a parliamentary system. President Fatima Jinnah welcomed the news, calling it a return to the historical norm. This is a unifying success for the ruling coalition."

 PAK_1965_Election.1.d:0 "The government announced Presidential elections will be held in three months, they outlined there would be one month of campaigning for the candidates. The 80,000 basic democrats will act as an electoral college for the indirect election, selecting the candidate. Nine projection meetings are to be held where each candidate can lay out their vision for Pakistan to the electors directly. These meetings will not be open for the public or media. President Ayub Khan is almost guaranteed to be the candidate for the Convention Muslim League, a pro-Ayub faction of the Pakistan Muslim League Party. Opposition leaders are condemning the short campaign season along with the indirect elections. They claim everything favors President Ayub Khan. A spokesman for the government denies this, claiming these elections represent a new era of democracy for Pakistan."
 PAK_1965_Election.2.d:0 "The major opposition parties announced their nomination of Fatima Jinnah for the Presidency. The five parties have formed a coalition called the Combined Opposition Party in order to pool resources to dethrone the Ayub Khan regime. Fatima Jinnah, sister of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the late founder of Pakistan, is widely popular among the people, affectionately known as the Mother of the Nation. The new coalition released a nine point program. Among its goals is to restore parliamentary democracy and universal suffrage, to dismantle the current indirect election system. Fatima Jinnah released a statement calling on the Pakistan people to unite for democracy and end the dictatorship of Ayub Khan."
 PAK_1965_Election.3.d:0 "Fatima Jinnah, the beloved sister of the venerated founder of Pakistan Muhammad Ali Jinnah is campaigning across Pakistan for the Presidency. She is the candidate for the Combined Opposition Party and is opposing the sitting President, Ayub Khan. Newspapers are publishing pictures and reporting on massive crowds coming out to see Jinnah. In her speeches Jinnah condemns the Ayub Khan regime for being too soft on India, secular, and anti-democratic. She wishes to restore democracy, end the current indirect election system, and more openly incorporate Islam to the state. As she remained largely out of the public eye since the early 1950s, many Pakistanis are coming to see her campaign and travel, many hoping to just have a glimpse of a woman seen as a great freedom fighter for independence and known across the nation as Mader-e Millat (mother of the nation)."
 PAK_1965_Election.4.d:0 "Over the past several weeks, a number of President Ayub Khan supporters and members of the media have published scathing articles and editorials against Fatima Jinnah. In addition, local authorities have allowed very conservative parties to hold demonstrations condemning the notion of a woman leader for Pakistan. This despite the fact that Jinnah has the endorsement of the largest religious party, the Jamaat-i-Islami. However, this campaign to discredit Jinnah has backfired. Intellectuals, politicians, and activists across the country have rallied to her support. Crowds of Pakistanis are also condemning the government for offending the reputation of a woman widely considered to be the Mader-e Millat (mother of the nation). The backlash is directly impacting the popularity of Ayub Khan."
 PAK_1965_Election.5.d:0 "The election season has kicked off with four candidates competing for the 80,000 basic democrat voters. This is the first major indirect franchise election in Pakistan history. The incumbent, President Ayub Khan is the heavy favorite, having established the current election system. The five major opposition parties organized under a coalition called the Combined Opposition Party and nominated the widely popular Fatima Jinnah. The other two candidates are from obscure backgrounds and not expected to play a major role. President Ayub Khan is expected to campaign on a platform of continuing his economic reforms and restoration of political stability. Fatima Jinnah will campaign on a platform calling for the restoration of a parliamentary system and a universal franchise for future elections."
 PAK_1965_Election.6.d:0 "Fatima Jinnah recently concluded a campaign tour of major cities in East and West Pakistan. At each stop she was met with massive, highly enthusiastic crowds. The crowds in East Pakistan were especially enthusiastic for the woman called the Mother of the Nation. She also condemned Ayub Khan for a weak stance with regards to India and supporting the Kashmiri people. Pro-Ayub activists spread disparaging comments regarding Fatima Jinnah, but these efforts at smearing her name largely alienated Pakistanis who still widely respect the sister of the beloved Mohammad Ali Jinnah. President Ayub Khan has focused his campaigning on rural areas, where his reforms have seen the most success. As most of the 80,000 basic democrats come from these areas, many believe this is a sound strategy. Despite the show of popular support, Ayub Khan is still expected to win."
 PAK_1965_Election.7.d:0 "A senior civil servant has privately approached Fatima Jinnah, asking her to visit a secret meeting of senior military and government officials. These officials come from a variety of backgrounds. Some hold her with reverence due to her closeness with Mohammad Ali Jinnah and her role in founding the nation. Others pragmatically note she is the more popular candidate but lacks support from the basic democrats. If Jinnah accepts, she may see an opportunity at overcoming the current election system. However, to do so she may have to make major compromises. She must decide whether to attend or not."
 PAK_1965_Election.8.d:0 "Under utmost security, senior government and military officials, many represented by trusted allies, met with Fatima Jinnah. In the meeting, she insisted her commitment to restoring parliamentary democracy and ending the indirect election system. She also noted Ayub Khan was holding the nation back and showing weakness to India. The officials present expressed support to her stance but stated they would only support her if she agreed to several demands. They stated she should refrain from calling Ayub Khan a dictator and allow him a peaceful retirement if she wins. They also demanded she maintain the current economic reforms or interfere in military affairs. The agreement would need to kept secret. Fatima Jinnah must decide what to do."
 PAK_1965_Election.9.d:0 "State media confirmed that Fatima Jinnah has won the 1965 Pakistan Presidential Elections. She won a majority of the popular vote, but more importantly, she won a slim majority of the 80,000 basic democrats who elect the President. Many analysts believe that despite the popularity of Jinnah, she would not be able to secure the electoral college which consists of mostly rural representatives with close ties to the incumbent, President Ayub Khan. Miss Jinnah released a statement thanking the basic democrats for supporting the wishes of the people. Millions are celebrating across cities in Pakistan, with the largest crowds in Dacca. Fatima Jinnah, the popular sister of the Pakistan founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah is widely respected. President Ayub Khan, who ceased power in a coup, did not release any statement over the results."
 PAK_1965_Election.10.d:0 "President Ayub Khan announced he accepts the election result and will retire from public life once the new government takes over. He pledged his loyalty to the nation and claimed his hope the people will recognize his devotion to them. Fatima Jinnah, the president elect, praised Ayub Khan for accepting the results. When asked if Ayub Khan and his political allies would be charged or investigated for corruption, she dismissed the notion. Her conciliatory comments were a major stepdown from some of her earlier, harsh criticisms of Ayub Khan. Despite his brave face, sources say Ayub Khan is stunned by the election results. The senior military leadership informed their former chief that they would back the new government, leaving him little choice but to retire."
 PAK_1965_Election.11.d:0 "The 1965 Presidential Elections occurred. The people of Pakistan are to elect 80,000 Basic Democrats who then voted for the president. When the final tally was released, President Ayub Khan was declared the winner, receiving over sixty percent of the vote. His victory was seen as a forgone conclusion as most the Basic Democrats were his appointees. However, analysts were still surprised by how many votes Fatima Jinnah ended up receiving. The reaction among many Pakistanis is disappointment as many felt she had the support of the people. Many in the country now view the constitution setup by Ayub Khan as rigged to keep him in power and there are now calls for more democratic reforms, especially from East Pakistan where Fatima Jinnah was especially popular."
 
 Jinnah_President.1.d:0 "The Pakistan government released a statement encouraging provinces to select cultural holidays relevant to local communities. This is a step back from the past where the federal government sought to impose a more unified, national identity at the expense of ethnic traditions or historical figures. The East Pakistan government welcomed the news, promising to hold holidays for great Bengali literary heroes. The NWFP released its own statement, calling for a Pashto language week to champion the great poets of the frontier. The move is part of an effort to find balance between the federal government and the provinces."
 Jinnah_President.2.d:0 "President Fatima Jinnah has called an extraordinary session of the National Assembly. In her address, she called on its members to work diligently to reform the constitution. She called for a balanced democracy that provided stability and gave power to the people. Jinnah is leading a coalition of different parties. Despite their varying ideologies, the coalition is united in their vision to undo the Ayub Khan democracy. Jinnah has deftly kept these parties together through her abilities and status as the sister of the late Pakistani founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah."
 Jinnah_President.3.d:0 "In the final session of the extraordinary National Assembly session, a series of amendments were passed that reduced Presidential powers. Under President Ayub Khan, he had given the President extensive powers. President Fatima Jinnah had long pushed for the reforms. She believed Pakistan had long been plagued by an overly powerful executive branch. Under the reforms, the President still retains powers, but no longer can act with complete impunity. The decision is being welcomed across all political circles. For the first time, it now appears Pakistan has balanced its political institutions."
 Jinnah_President.4.d:0 "After a long cabinet meeting, President Fatima Jinnah announced a boycott of Indian goods. She stated though the decision reflected the feelings of the people. If the Indian government continues its hostility towards Pakistan, there is no reason to engage them with trade. The President campaigned on maintaining a hardline towards the Indian government. The Pakistan military is said to be thrilled with the decision. The embargo is being widely supported by most circles in the country. However, some critics point out the decision only hurts the economy. Internationally, many states expressed concern over the escalation of tensions."
 Jinnah_President.5.d:0 "President Fatima Jinnah ended a recent session of the National Assembly. Since taking over the presidency, she has reversed the presidential power and restored a parliamentary system of government. Learning from previous mistakes, she has sought to reduce presidential powers to create a balanced executive branch. Despite her reforms and amendments to the constitution, her coalition looks increasingly fractured. Many political pundits believe it is only her personality and prestige that keeps the present government in power. Regardless, she has achieved her vision and all Pakistanis can now enjoy full voting privileges for upcoming elections."
 Jinnah_President.6.d:0 "The nation was stunned to learn President Fatima Jinnah passed away overnight from heart failure. Although rushed to the hospital, she was pronounced dead on arrival. During her brief tenure, she transformed Pakistan, amending the constitution to provide universal suffrage and a more balanced parliamentary democracy. New elections are expected to be announced soon. The ruling coalition brought together a myriad of parties with vastly different ideologies, the reputation of Jinnah and their mission to remove Ayub Khan kept it intact. She will also be remembered as the first woman to govern a Muslim-majority state. A massive state funeral is planned for Karachi. She is expected to be buried next to her brother at the Mazar-e-Quaid."

 PAK_MAAG.1.d:0 "With the completion of the first phase of MAAG, there are many in the military who want to approach the Americans to immediately begin the next phase with new arms to modernize the military. The Army is keen to expand the armoured forces while the Air Force has expressed interest in acquiring more advanced fighters from the United States. The Navy would like to ensure a new, more modern submarine for the fleet. However, approaching the Americans may require us to be more firmly connected to their interests. It may be better to modernize our forces through our own efforts to retain independence."
 PAK_MAAG.2.d:0 "The Pakistanis have requested more military aid to modernize their forces through a new phase of MAAG. The first phase was a success and our officers on the ground did send glowing reports regarding the Pakistan Army. However, there were and remain doubts on whether Pakistan can economically maintain an extensive military. In addition, many are suspicious they primarily want this military equipment not to deter communism but to confront their rival India. India is also very sensitive to our military relationship to Pakistan and a new effort at providing weapons will not be received well. If we do decide to provide the equipment they desire, we must demand Pakistan denounce the Soviet Union and Communist China and provide military bases for us to demonstrate their sincerity. Or we can preserve ties with India and politely decline their request."
 PAK_MAAG.3.d:0 "The Americans have agreed to extend MAAG support for an additional infantry division, armored division, and mechanized brigade, along with artillery. For the Air Force they will provide some more advanced fighters and expand our bombers. The navy would also receive a new submarine. In exchange they have asked us to severely roll back our ties with China and the Soviet Union. They also seek to have bases in our country. Such a deal will provide us much equipment but severely affects our foreign policy and will likely lead to domestic unrest over the agreement. Some ministers are urging that we politely reject the offer and pursue a more independent defence and foreign policy agenda."
 PAK_MAAG.4.d:0 "News of our recent agreement with the United States has seen a large backlash across the country. Leftists, anti-colonial, and religious groups have rallied their supporters to protest across all major cities. The government is being condemned for selling out the country. India has largely denounced the agreement, blaming America for fueling the arms race in South Asia. Despite the loud protests, both the United States and Pakistani government welcomed the agreement as vital to preserving Pakistan and halting communism in the region."
 PAK_MAAG.5.d:0 "The government was informed that the military had taken possession of all weapons and systems promised by the Americans. The military also stated it did not foresee any major issues with its forces operating the weapon systems as American trainers had provided extensive help in that regard. The government noted its satisfaction with the report and lauded the military for its efforts to ensure the nation maintained a strong, robust capable of thwarting any hostile plans or adventures."
 Ayub.1.d:0 "The director of the ISI, the premier intelligence agency of the country met with President Ayub Khan. President Ayub Khan was meeting to discuss the possibility of having intelligence assets mobilized to monitor domestic politics and potential threats to his regime. The current government is essential to saving Pakistan from foreign aggression and the corruption that plagued the early years of the country. The director stated that the agency could certainly aid the government but doing so would compromise their ability to monitor foreign threats. It must be decided if the ISI should sacrifice its foreign intelligence capabilities and work to bolster the regime or stay out of politics all together."
 Ayub.2.d:0 "Soon after taking power, President Ayub Khan appointed the former Chief Justice Shahabuddin to chair a commission to propose a constitutional framework that will avoid the political instability and corruption of the earlier regime. The report came out and proposed a presidential system of government instead of parliamentary. The new system would be bicameral with an upper house meant to check the lower one. The President would enjoy powerful executive powers, especially over the appointment of governors. The commission recommended a return of political parties and all elected officials must pass education requirements. Elections would be based on universal suffrage. President Ayub could accept the report as is to form a democratic constitution but his advisors suggest he propose revisions, that strengthen Presidential powers, preserve his Basic Democrats electoral system, and keep the ban on political parties. Ayub is inclined to offer revisions and establish a more presidential constitution."
 Pak_Econ60s.1.d:0 "As we go through the ambitious Five Year Plan the issue of securing financing has arisen. We will certainly maximize the avenues of raising funds domestically, but we are a young, poor nation and to transform it we need access to higher financing. The United States has expressed a willingness to offer financial aid and facilitate access to international aid from their allies. The government is inclined to maximize such financial aid to truly transform the nation in this critical juncture. However, several ministers have expressed concerns that relying on such funds may leave Pakistan financially vulnerable, and though it may slow the potential growth, pursuing moderate aid maybe the more prudent decision to make. We must decide whether to maximize the American aid or ask for moderate aid to cover some of the gaps in our financing efforts."
 Pak_Econ60s.2.d:0 "The Five Year Plan has been massively successful, in large parts due to our ability to raise financial aid and friendly loans. However, these payments have reached a critical level. The government must now devote a substantial part of the budget to meet these obligations. The economic developments spurred by these funds have not yet reached a level to facilitate the continued growth of the country and its payment commitments. As a result, the economic objectives for the coming years must be readjusted to this stark financial situation."
 Pak_Econ60s.3.d:0 "The Five Year Plan has been massively successful, in large parts due to our ability to raise financial aid and friendly loans. However, these payments have reached a critical level. The government must now devote a substantial part of the budget to meet these obligations. The economic developments spurred by these funds have not yet reached a level to facilitate the continued growth of the country and its payment commitments. Luckily, the commitments are not overwhelming, and the Finance Minister insists that the country will soon resolve the crisis and return to its economic objectives. As a result, the economic objectives for the coming years must be readjusted to this stark financial situation."
 PAK_Land_Reform.1.d:0 "One of the early actions of the Ayub Khan government was to take on the feudal system which long dominated the agricultural sector and caused extreme hardship to the peasants working the land. Reforms were made to limit the maximum amount of land owned by an individual and ensure some basic rights for peasants. Although many believe these reforms possess too many loopholes to be transformative, the new land ownership requirement has seen the government seize millions of acres of unproductive lands. This land can be used to bolster agricultural production and the economy. A senior advisor noted that though the land could be distributed to productive peasant farmers, this land could also be given as retirement grants for junior officers in the military. This would reward their services to the state and strengthen their loyalty to Ayub Khan. The government must decide whether the land should go to peasants or the officers."
 PAK_Land_Reform.2.d:0 "The government announced it was currently handing out parcels of unproductive lands under its stewardship to peasants across Pakistan. The government noted the system of feudal agriculture has long plagued agricultural productivity in Pakistan, but this was being rectified. The government noted its shock at the amount of viable land being unutilized in the country. The press and public have largely welcomed the news from the government. The popular measure will help Ayub Khan endear himself to the population, but the traditional rural elite are said to be seething over the measures, which they see as a humiliation targeting them."
 PAK_Land_Reform.3.d:0 "The government announced it would parcel out the unproductive lands under its stewardship as retirement rewards for officers in the Pakistan Army, Air Force, and Navy. The government noted that as a poor nation, Pakistani officers sacrificed financial and material opportunities in service of the nation. This land would act as a modest but just reward for their service as military men possessed the discipline, and patriotism to ensure such lands would not be wasted as it had previously. The action is being well-received by the government-controlled press and the officer corps. Ayub Khan can certainly count on his officers for the foreseeable future."
 PAK_Financial.1.d:0 "The Planning Committee for the Five Year Plan and the Finance Minister approached President Ayub Khan to discuss options on boosting the flow of cash and private capital. There is a proposal for new legislation on industry that would largely remove financial regulations and practices in order to encourage the expansion of industry and push for maximum growth. Some on the Committee however, caution this deregulation, warning it may lead to more fiscal problems down the line. Instead they believe certain outdated and economically conservative elements can be reformed or removed to encourage a modest growth."
 PAK_Financial.2.d:0 "The government announced an unprecedented relaxation on regulations, especially those related to industry. This new policy is meant to help fuel rapid economic growth for Pakistan and its industrial base. Along with this reform, the government announced plans to pass a series of legislation focused on strengthening and streamlining funding for industrial projects. The Finance Minister called on both international investors and local businesses to take advantage of the friendly business atmosphere in Pakistan. He insisted concerns over worker rights or the long-term effects of these actions are greatly exaggerated and these policies are essential for the prosperity of Pakistan now."
 PAK_Financial.3.d:0 "The Finance Ministry released a statement describing a series of reforms meant to reduce regulations and hinderances for growth in the industry sector of the economy. The statement noted this would not be a free for all and efforts were made to preserve some protections from overspending or organizations over committing. The government later released its own comments and called on all interested parties to take advantage of the friendly business atmosphere and great potential of Pakistan and its people."
 PAK_Financial.4.d:0 "The deregulation policies meant to spur industrial expansion and economic growth have led to corporations falling into deep debts, greatly hindering economic growth. The reduction of protections, especially for workers have also seen an economic decline among those populations, slowing the economy further and hurting efficiency. The decline in government coffers means their ability to spur growth and keep cash flowing has greatly reduced. The Finance Minister announced revised figures for industrial growth and has restored some regulations in order to halt the economic slowdown."
 PAK_Financial.5.d:0 "The deregulation policies meant to spur industrial expansion and economic growth have led to corporations falling into deep debts, hindering economic growth. The reduction of protections, especially for workers have cut their wage earnings and add fuel to the lackluster performance of local industries and businesses. The decline in government coffers means their ability to spur growth and keep cash flowing has greatly reduced. The Finance Minister announced revised figures for industrial growth and has restored some regulations in order to halt the economic slowdown. However, the ministry noted it believed this downturn would be temporary and he expects the economy to recover soon."

 Bengal_Issue_Ayub.1.d:0 "The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. When war initially broke out over Kashmir, rumors spread that West Pakistan had abandoned East Pakistan. Unfortunately, the resulting conflict seemed to confirm this suspicion. The lack of major military formations in the province and a perceived lackluster response by the authorities to establish air raid shelters or warning systems fueled a feeling of abandonment. Our forces and officials acted as effectively as they could, but unfortunately this was not appreciated by the East Pakistani population."
 Bengal_Issue_Ayub.2.d:0 "The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. Many opposed the military takeover by Ayub Khan and this opposition intensified when he unveiled his Basic Democrat system. For many East Pakistanis, Ayub Khan has implemented a system meant to deny East Pakistanis proportional representation and limit their political aspirations. Crowds of Bengalis, especially students, are regularly protesting for democratic governance."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.1.d:0 "Ever since Sheikh Mujibur Rahman released his dangerous Six Points he has caused mass unrest among Bengalis across East Pakistan. The Bengalis are increasingly being attracted to an anti-state path and the status quo does not appear to be a solution right now. The question is how to approach this difficult problem without causing more problems or fueling separatist tendencies among Bengalis. One approach is to discredit Rahman and his Awami League. Our intelligence agencies have discovered a plot involving separatists and the Indian government. Pursuing this case publicly would expose the Awami League as the traitors we know them to be. Many advisors support this approach. The other option is to reduce restrictions on public protests. This would be a concession that allows us to invite the Awami League for high-level talks regarding the future of East Pakistan. We would likely have to compromise but swiftly moving in that direction could reduce the possibility of armed resistance."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.2.d:0 "After a deep investigation, the ISI informed the government of a vast conspiracy it uncovered in East Pakistan. According to their agents, leading members of the Awami League, along with Bengali military officers and civil servants have conspired to organize an armed uprising for a separate state. Many of the key conspirators, including top aids of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were holding these talks in the Indian town of Agartala, often with Indian intelligence and military officials to secure their support for the uprising. Our intelligence agent at one point was fired upon by some conspirators but still managed to bring the information. The government will soon issue arrest warrants and announce the charges against the accused."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.3.d:0 "The nation of Pakistan was stunned this morning over reports that military officers, civil servants, and Awami League members, including party leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were arrested. They are being charged by the government for conspiring with India to launch an insurrection against the state of Pakistan. The government statement suggests the recent efforts by the Awami League to demand more autonomy was only a ploy made under Indian guidance to weaken Pakistan. President Ayub Khan in his own statement called for a swift trial to reveal the truth of this evil conspiracy. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in his statement denied the charges, calling them fabricated and a desperate attempt to silence the voice of the Bengali majority."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.4.d:0 "The long-awaited trial of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his alleged conspirators began today. The court is a tribunal led by three judges, one non-Bengali the other two Bengali. They are to hear evidence that the accused plotted an armed uprising against Pakistan with the help of a foreign power, India. The case will see over 200 witnesses along with evidence to support an extensive charge list. However, there is widespread anger over the case in East Pakistan. Many accuse the government of fabricating the charges in a conspiracy against autonomy for East Pakistan. These claims were fueled by revelations from a British attorney aiding the accused that some of the witnesses admitted to being coerced into testifying. Large protests are occurring daily, calling for the case to be dismissed."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.5.d:0 "The Agartala Conspiracy trial continues to alienate and spur protest among Bengalis in East Pakistan. As the trial continues, more and more Bengalis increasingly view the charges as outlandish and a plot meant to silence the popular Sheikh Mujubur Rahman. In a recent development, students, especially from Dacca University, have started joining the protests. This agitation continues to negatively impact the economy and functioning of the state. The government however remains defiant and claims it will not halt its pursuit of justice. However, it continues to face accusations that witnesses were coerced and documents were falsified."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.6.d:0 "The Bengali protestors agitating for the dismissal of charges against those accused in the Agartala Conspiracy trial have formed an Action Committee. The Action Committee, directed by Awami League activists plans on organizing protests, strikes, and agitation in order to maximize the impact against the government. President Ayub Khan had hoped the case would show the people of East Pakistan the danger of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and expose him as a separatist, however, it appears this effort has backfired. Even pro-democracy activists in West Pakistan are beginning to voice support for Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as the case is turning into an anti-Ayub cause."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.7.d:0 "Dacca was swept in violence following news that Sergeant Zahurul Haq, one of the accused in the Agartala Conspiracy Case was shot by a guard. Although he was rushed to the local military hospital, Haq succumbed to his wounds. It is unclear what led to the shooting but news of it caused massive mobs to start fires at government buildings and the State House where the case is being heard. The three tribunal judges managed to escape but the resulting attacks saw widespread fires that burned evidence and documents related to the case. The next morning massive crowds returned to Dacca to condemn the killing and accuse the government of trying to assassinate the accused as the court case was stalling."
 Agartala_Conspiracy.8.d:0 "President Ayub Khan directed the government to withdraw the Agartala Conspiracy case and dismiss the charges against the accused. In a statement the government insisted it had the evidence to convict but the circumstances on the ground and instability made the trial unsustainable. After his release from prison, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and the other accused went to a massive public reception at a Dacca racecourse. He was met with jubilant crowds who chanted his new title among the people, the Friend of Bengal. In his comments Rahman insisted the Six Points were not separatist nor anti-Pakistan and stated his appreciation for the people who stopped a dictator from erasing the opposition and voice of the people. Many Bengalis view this episode as a great victory, and many in East Pakistan are now firmly in support of the Awami League, making the trial a major blunder from Ayub Khan."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.1.d:0 "Following the decision of the government to lift restrictions on protests, the Awami League and its leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman agreed to hold talks with President Ayub Khan over the Six Points. Mujibur Raham released the Six Points earlier as the basis for relations between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. Critics note the Six Points separates almost all institutions in the country and would leave East Pakistan virtually independent. However, supporters of the Six Points state its implementation would stop tensions between the two wings and allow both to grow together instead of at the expense of each other. The talks are expected to be long and difficult, but many across the country are said to find this recent government initiative a positive step."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.2.d:0 "During the initial phase of discussions, both the government and Awami League laid out their negotiating positions. However, it has become clear that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman appears unwilling to compromise on his hugely popular Six Points and has called on the government to adopt it for East Pakistan. He stated this was the only route to ensure peace and unity for all of Pakistan. The government side is said to be annoyed by this posturing. However, some of the advisors for Ayub Khan suggest he can offer East Pakistan greater autonomy, essentially adopting several of the Six Points but not conceding on granting East Pakistan an independent economy or completely independent defence force. The other option would be to walk out of the talks, this would be seen as popular to West Pakistanis but would effectively fail at resolving the tensions in East Pakistan."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.3.d:0 "President Ayub Khan carefully laid out a proposal to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman over the future status of East Pakistan. He noted his appreciation that many in the province desire major change in the relationship between both wings. However, he stated as is, the Six Points was not a feasible solution. Instead he has offered to grant East Pakistan extensive autonomy, giving it control of its development funds, taxation, and internal policies. However, he could not grant a completely independent economy or an independent defence force. Though he offered concessions on both, including giving control of the East Pakistan Rifles to the East Pakistan legislature. For Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, this would grant him many of the Six Points and achieve his goal of autonomy. He and key supporters are inclined to accept the compromise. However, some hardliners in the party insist they remain committed to the Six Points and reject the proposal."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.4.d:0 "President Ayub Khan abruptly ended the Round Table talks and returned to West Pakistan. He stated his government sought to earnestly discuss outstanding issues with the Awami League but the group proved unwilling to negotiate for the betterment of the people of Pakistan. Many editorials in West Pakistan spoke in favor of the President, stating he had made the right decision and exposed Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as a dishonest politician who harbors dangerous designs for the future of Pakistan. In East Pakistan, the Awami League blamed the government for acting rashly and using the talks as a means to score political points with their base. Although they received support from pro-democracy newspapers, they also faced criticism, especially from the other major East Pakistani parties who accused the Awami League of pushing a radical agenda against the will of many Bengalis and Biharis living in East Pakistan."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.5.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, leader of the Awami League told the government he accepted their compromise. He personally told President Ayub Khan that the Bengali people would not forget his decision to listen to their desires. The President reciprocated the kind words and stated his hope that the new agreement would herald a new era for Pakistan. It was decided that a formal agreement would not be signed, and once the President informed the senior government officials, a final agreement could be made. Until then, both sides agreed not to reveal the details or preliminary agreement reached as it could be changed. When the talks ended, both sides released a statement noting great progress had been made and future talks were likely. Analysts noted neither pro-government or pro-Awami League publications sought to criticize the other side and as President Ayub Khan returned to Pakistan, a sense of optimism prevailed."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.6.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the leader of the Awami League rejected the proposal by the government to offer much greater autonomy for East Pakistan. President Ayub Khan thought the offer was fair as it met most of the Six Points, but the Awami League still refused. The talks quickly concluded afterwards and both sides released terse statements. The government accused the Awami League of negotiating dishonestly and rejecting reasonable offers. The Awami League stated it would not compromise on the dignity of the people of East Pakistan. Nationally, supporters of the government were satisfied with its actions. Although the Awami League supporters are satisfied, their hardline has alienated those on the fence."
 Awami_League_Round_Table.7.d:0 "In stunning news, the expected agreement between the government and Awami League has fallen through. The Awami League claims the government sought to change the agreed upon terms and it could not accept them. Nationally there is much disappointment at the failure of the government to complete an agreement. President Ayub Khan is quiet over the failure, but analysts suspect the Pakistan military likely spoke against the proposed agreement. Without the support of the military, the government had no choice but to let the agreement fail. With both sides dug in on their stances, there is little hope for the future."
 PAK_1965_Economy.1.d:0 "In response to a series of media reports on corruption within the country, including accusations against family members of President Ayub, the government has published its own reports on corruption. The government identified key leaders in black market training and families which possess excessive amounts of wealth and land. The government has promised to crackdown on these issues to lower the prices of goods and force such families to pay their share of taxes to the state. Many in the public have welcomed this new initiative."
 PAK_1965_Economy.1.d:0 "Since the last war ended, the country faces the dilemma on how it must rebuild. Some advocate the priority should be on rebuilding the national economy. However, considering the continued security situation we face, there are many who advocate a focus on rebuilding our military capacity. Rebuilding the economy could provide us with a long-term base to establish a stronger defence industry. However, neglecting the armed forces now could lead to disaster if India or Afghanistan choose to challenge us. We must determine where to put our limited resources in recovering from the war."
 PAK_1965_Economy.3.d:0 "The economy is currently suffering a downturn, mostly due to the increasing debt incurred by the government and excessive spending by banks. The Finance Minister is worried the current interest rate is too low and we should raise it in order to control the potential of a crisis of payments. Some advisors worry raising interest rates will alienate business interests and hurt growth, but sometimes the government must make the difficult decisions. The choice of how to act lies with the President."
 PAK_1965_Economy.4.d:0 "Many banks across Pakistan are reporting they are running dangerously low on funds and are struggling to recoup the credit they have been extending. A lot of this is due to government encouragement of financing and the current interest rates. The banks will be a lot more reluctant to hand out financing and will need time to rebuild their assets. This is a major blow for the economic health of the country, but we will persevere and prosper."
 PAK_1965_Economy.5.d:0 "The Pakistan government recently sent a delegation of top economic officials to discuss the continuation of financing for its economic programs. The Pakistanis noted that American aid in securing foreign financing had greatly aided the government in its last economic plan. They noted that for Pakistan to finally turn the corner economically, it needs more support. We have to decide if we want to continue supporting the Pakistani economy. This would improve relations and give us more leverage with them. However, there are others who argue too much funding will make Pakistan dependent on such support and hurt their economy in the long-term, we must decide what to do."
 PAK_1965_Economy.6.d:0 "We received excellent news from Washington. The US agreed to continue supporting our economy through economic aid and loans. They will also help us secure funding from other friendly states to keep the economy booming. Although some advisors worry our dependence on such funding will lead to long-term issues, the benefits now can truly transform our nation into a modern economy. The Finance Minister is already drawing up plans to use the funding for major development projects. Ideally with this support, the entire nation will soon reap the benefits of a booming economy."

 SINO_PAK.1.d:0 "Initial relations with China and Pakistan were hindered by geopolitical alignments and border disputes. However, a recent initiative by Pakistan to hold talks on the disputed border were accepted by the Chinese. After weeks of fruitful negotiations, the two sides came to an agreement. The agreement saw both nations commit to demarcate their border. Pakistan also agreed to cede the Karakoram Tract to China. The Chinese and Pakistani government see the agreement as the beginning of a genuine friendship. Although the reaction has been largely positive among the people, the Indian government is strongly criticizing it. Many Indian newspapers argue Pakistan has no right to even cede the lands it did. Regardless, it appears Pakistan and China have turned a corner in their relationship."
 SINO_PAK.2.d:0 "The Pakistan and Chinese government announced both sides had begun constructing a land route which will link the two countries together. The proposed route will connect the NWFP and Punjab to Xinjiang via Gilgit-Baltistan. The two sides agreed the highway will cross from the Khunjerab pass. The Pakistani construction will be done by the Frontier Works Organization which plans on using the Pakistan Army Corps of Engineers for the project. The proposed project will be one of the longest, highest all-weather highways on the planet. The Pakistani government notes the project will restore the ancient Silk Road connections and restore the historical contact between the people of Pakistan and China."
 SINO_PAK.3.d:0 "Construction on the Karakoram Highway continues for both Pakistan and China. So far there have been dozens of fatalities due to avalanches and extreme conditions. A Chinese cemetery has been established in Gilgit. However, despite the hardships, the project continues, and Pakistani engineers are learning valuable lessons in road construction and planning. Indian experts have expressed concern that the proposed route, when completed would allow China the ability to send supplies or even troops at any time of the year, regardless of weather conditions. Currently many Himalaya paths and routes are inaccessible for large scale military movements from January to April."
 SINO_PAK.4.d:0 "The Pakistani and Chinese Foreign Ministries released a statement announcing the Karakoram Highway was entering its final phase of construction. It noted that despite extreme dangers, both Pakistani and Chinese workers continue to work diligently and enthusiastically for the betterment of their people. Foreign correspondents have been taken to completed portions of the highway and their reports describe a highly durable roadway. Both governments continue to praise and publicize the difficult engineering feats accomplished and cooperation between both nations. The Frontier Works Organization has used the experiences gained from the project to greatly expand its engineering capabilities."
 SINO_PAK.5.d:0 "In a splendid ceremony the first truck, loaded with goods, left from Kashgar in China. It was received by cheering crowds when it arrived in Abbottabad in Pakistan, marking the official opening of the Karakoram Highway. Later, the Pakistan government hosted a celebratory banquet with their Chinese counterparts and diplomats. The Chinese media praised the opening of what they call the Friendship Highway. In Pakistan, the leading newspapers described the road as the Eighth Wonder of the World. The new highway ensures Pakistan and Chinese land links will be year-round, aiding trade and contact. Strategically, and to the concern of India, the route ensures China could militarily or materially support Pakistan even during the hostile winter season. The Frontier Works Organization is now the premier military engineering organization in Pakistan."

 PRC_PACT.1.d:0 "Only India knows the threat from China firsthand. Although we have our differences with India, it may be necessary to put our mutual hostilities on hold for the near future. Reports on the Chinese borders continue to send alarm bells across the government. Of course, there are still many outstanding issues with India and an attempt to rapidly normalize ties could potentially spark unrest. However, several senior officials suggest we can offer India either a three year or five-year non-aggression pact. This would allow both nations the opportunity to work on shoring up weaknesses in regard to China. Some military leaders suggest the whole initiative is foolish and Pakistan must deal with China on its own. The cabinet must now decide to propose one of the non-aggression options or the cabinet could decide to just scrap the proposed initiative."
 PRC_PACT.2.d:0 "The Foreign Minister received his Pakistani counterpart who offered an unprecedented proposal. He offered to sign a three-year non-aggression pact with our government that will guarantee no chance of conflict during the length of the agreement. The Pakistanis are currently concerned with their border with China. They fear the Chinese plan to take lands they occupy the same way they recently did to ours. The three-year period would allow their government and our own to better prepare our territories from future Chinese aggression and may offer the first steps towards wider peace. However, some military leaders expressed concerns the proposal is a ploy to facilitate a future Pakistani offensive at a time of their convenience. The cabinet must decide how to respond."

 PRC_PACT.4.d:0 "In a surprising development, the Pakistani and Indian government announced a new three-year agreement pledging mutual non-aggression called the Indo-Pakistan Non-Aggression Pact. The two traditional South Asian rivals were motivated into this agreement over fears of an increasingly assertive Chinese foreign policy. Analysts believe the agreement will allow both states to focus more on better preparing their position along the Chinese border and solidify their domestic base without the threat of a wider South Asian war. The Chinese condemned the agreement as a conspiracy while Western states welcomed the move. Domestically, the reaction has been muted though in Pakistan there were some protests against the government cooperating with India."

 PRC_PACT.6.d:0 "The unprecedented Indo-Pakistan Non-Aggression Pact has formally expired. Pakistan proposed the agreement out of concern over China. India, which also has outstanding border issues with China, welcomed the agreement as an opportunity to build up its own capabilities to deal with the Chinese threat. The agreement did see a small flourishing of ties and cultural exchange between India and Pakistan. However, with the agreement now expired, there are fears that a new arms race between India and Pakistan may escalate. Despite the successful agreement, progress in other issues would be necessary to see Pakistan and India transform their ties from one of rivalry to friendship."
 PRC_PACT.7.d:0 "The Foreign Minister returned from India with disappointing news. The Indian government refused to sign our proposed non-aggression pact. They cited security concerns and noted they were a peace-loving nation uninterested in warmongering. However, it is clear that India remains a potent threat to our national security. As the situation with China continues to develop, our forces and intelligence must remain vigilant to the nefarious plans of the enemy. Adding insult to injury the Indian government leaked the proposal in a way that made our government look weak. The Chinese are said to be upset over what they called a proposed anti-Chinese alliance."
 
 PAK_SEC.1.d:0 "The United States has watched our struggles with China closely and their officials on the ground have expressed sympathies to the communist threat north of us. We can dispatch a high-powered diplomatic mission to the United States to ask for security support. America can be a strong bulwark against communist aggression. However, some cabinet members worry about our increased dependency on America and fear such a mission could be seen as a sign of weakness by a population inherently hostile to perceived imperial powers."
 PAK_SEC.2.d:0 "A high-level Pakistani military and diplomatic mission has spent the last few days visiting the Pentagon, Congress, and White House in an effort to shore up support for their nation. The Pakistanis are fearful of communist Chinese aggression on its borders and are asking for help in collecting equipment for up to three new mountain divisions. The State Department and Pentagon have provided three options for how we can respond to the Pakistanis. One is to provide equipment for the raising of three mountain divisions, which will infuriate India. The second is to provide non-lethal aid and mountain warfare training support, this would reduce Indian anger and not humiliate the Pakistanis. Finally, we can simply decline to provide any aid, which will likely hurt relations with Pakistan but they are quite dependent on our support so such a diplomatic setback would be temporary."
 PAK_SEC.3.d:0 "In response to our request for help to deal with the China threat, the United States has agreed to provide equipment for us to eventually raise three mountain divisions. As we have told the United States since we gained independence, as long as they provide the tools, we can best train, equip, and deploy our men. The governments of China and India have both bitterly criticized the American decision, but this is of no concern as the security of Pakistan is far more vital of a concern. Editorials across the country are portraying the military aid as the result of a pragmatic government policy to marshal friends."
 PAK_SEC.4.d:0 "In response to our request for help to deal with the China threat, the United States announced it would provide nonlethal aid and advanced mountain warfare training to us. Though this is a disappointing result, as many in the Army hoped American equipment could help it raise new formations, it will still provide valuable support to Pakistan. The government welcomed the American decision but privately were disappointed. Some editorials noted the aid was far less than requested and suggest the United States limited its aid to reduce Indian anxiety over the matter. The Chinese government expressed concern over the increasing presence of the United States to the region. American military experts are expected to soon arrive and modernize the mountain warfare training facilities in Pakistan."
 
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.1.d:0 "A Holy Relic was stolen from the famed Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar. The relic is believed by locals to be strand of hair of the Prophet, originally seized in the seventeenth century by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. When news spread of the theft, tens of thousands took to the street to protest in Kashmir. The Indian and local government are investigating the matter, but the protests are being noted for their size and many observers see this spontaneous agitation as a sign of Kashmiri political agitation over their international status. The Pakistani government has a moral obligation to the people of Kashmir and a decision must be made. Should Pakistan pursue a military option to decisively liberate Kashmir or should it instead focus on diplomatic and intelligence efforts to force India into accepting the UN resolutions on the issue?"
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.2.d:0 "The Pakistani government is giving voice to miscreants and agitators in their occupied Kashmir. They have upgraded the transmission feed for their so-called Radio Free Kashmir. Their broadcasts encourage communalism, spread false propaganda, and agitate for protests. We have already protested to the Pakistani diplomatic mission who claim the radio network is a product of independent Kashmiri activists. Clearly this is an effort by the Pakistani government to spread unrest among the people of Kashmir."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.3.d:0 "The so-called Radio Free Kashmir recently expanded its transmission feed and broadcasting power to reach more parts of Kashmir. Their broadcasts have long spread Pakistani propaganda and false information, but recently the broadcasts are now encouraging armed resistance. Kashmiris are being called to fight back against our government through any means necessary and also to sabotage government projects in the region. Once again, our calls to the Pakistan government to halt such rhetoric is being ignored, but military commanders on the ground are confident they can control the Kashmiri unrest. Our officials and agents on the ground will track any locals involved in spreading Pakistani propaganda. The broadcasts are being fueled by rumors of political changes for Kashmir within the constitution."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.4.d:0 "We have successfully identified a number of Kashmiris acting as agents to the Pakistani state. We know they are providing information, often false, for the so-called Radio Free Kashmir to broadcast. These broadcasts are driving a wedge with our relationship to Kashmir and efforts to curtail its broadcasts have not worked. Some senior police and military officials advise we swiftly detain these agents and try them under the sedition laws. Making an example of them will show our government to be strong and send a message. Others in the cabinet instead suggest we simply monitor these individuals and privately approach them and use either conciliatory or coercive methods to convince them to halt their activities. We must decide how to handle this situation."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.5.d:0 "Across Pakistan, tens of thousands took to the streets to condemn the Indian occupation of Kashmir. Flags of Azad Kashmir flew with Pakistani flags as speakers spent the day condemning the atrocities and oppression in Indian occupied Kashmir. Government officials and ministers joined in many of these protests, pledging the continued devotion of Pakistan to the liberation of Kashmir and its people. The Foreign Ministry released statements across its diplomatic mission highlighting the violence and unrest in occupied Kashmir. This massive public display is meant to shore up government support on the issue and raise international awareness on the disputed territory."
 PAK_Kashmir_Unrest.6.d:0 "With the public behind us and the people of Indian occupied Kashmir clamoring for a resolution, the moment is right to approach the United Nations in regard to India implementing the UN resolutions related to Kashmir. India is of course a large nation and seemingly committed to its occupation. However, we have drafted a resolution demanding India comply with the resolution or face economic sanctions. The recent unrest in Kashmir and our public efforts have raised awareness internationally. If the United States and Soviet Union do not veto the resolution, we can put immense economic pressure on India until they comply. However, the Foreign Minister suggests that before approaching the United Nations, we should ask first ask India if they would like to hold comprehensive talks, if this effort fails, then we may go to the UN."

 CML_Bhutto.1.d:0 "Considering the situation Pakistan finds itself, the military found it had no choice but to hand power over to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto controls the largest political party in Pakistan and has had electoral success which gives him a legitimacy no military leader possesses. Bhutto in his opening speech promised to rebuild Pakistan both physically and as a people. He has promised to listen to all voices in the country and begin the process of transitioning the country towards a constitution all Pakistanis can approve of. He added his current title of Chief Martial Law Administrator and President were only temporary and meant to aid in the initial rebuilding of the country. His speech was well-received and many see it as a good sign for the future of Pakistan."

 DemRahman65.1.d:0 "The government passed legislation that nationalized the steel industry. This is the latest measures by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to push the nation towards a socialist economy. The nationalization is meant to increase productivity, curtail corruption, and end any exploitation of workers. Rahman told reporters after the vote that the era of crony capitalism in Pakistan was over. He further stated that government guidance and funding would expand productivity and lead to a more efficient industry. Critics point out the government may not have the capability or experience to run such an industry and there are worries that corruption could undermine the process. Regardless, the announcement is expected to be popular among many in the country."
 DemRahman65.2.d:0 "During a recent National Assembly debate, members of the government asked the Foreign Minister questions regarding tie with the United States. These parliamentarians question how Pakistan could maintain friendly ties with a nation openly engaged with colonial powers and at times perpetuating continued colonial rule across the globe. The Foreign Minister agreed with those statements and insisted the government would re-evaluate ties between Pakistan and the United States. Many observers noted this display in parliament was likely staged by the government to showcase why Pakistan wanted to move away from the United States and establish closer ties to socialist states. The American Ambassador noted his disappointment with the comments made at the National Assembly while the State Department in Washington abruptly cancelled a planned visit of senior economic officials to Pakistan. Pakistan likewise cancelled plans to welcome an American military mission to the country. The Chinese and Soviet government are said to be happy with these recent events."

 Dem_Ayub.1.d:0 "The President is soon to visit Dahka and there remains tension over the continued controversy of Bengali being a national language. For the people of East Pakistan, despite the National Assembly elevating the language, there is still bitterness over the amount of resistance from the government and Pakistanis from the western wing. For many leaders in West Pakistan, there are arguments that Urdu should be the only national language as it is the language of Islam in South Asia. Another faction believes if Bengali can be elevated, then so should all the major regional languages, like Punjabi, Sindhi, Pastho, and Balochi. The President will give a speech at the provincial legislature and should articulate his opinion on the debate or ignore the issue."
 Dem_Ayub.2.d:0 "Representatives from East Pakistan with supporters from some of the smaller ethnic groups have proposed the creation of Federal Quotas. The backers of the bill note Bengalis, despite making up the largest proportion of the Pakistani population are currently underrepresented in the Civil Service and virtually all federal agencies. In addition, Bengali representation in the military is very low. The new law will require federal agencies and the military to ensure each major ethnic group is proportionately represented in their organizations per the latest census data. The state institutions and supporters of President Ayub Khan have expressed opposition to the law, stating these institutions are already rectifying the situation but too rapid a transition may result in inefficiencies. The opponents point out that it has been over a decade since independence and meaningful change has yet to occur. The vote soon commenced."
 Dem_Ayub.3.d:0 "Under the brief regime of Ayub Khan, the Civil Service was mobilized in support of the regime and many noted the strong military-civil service alliance that formed against the old political order. With a new constitution and democratic constitution in place, the National Assembly must decide what to do with the expanded role of the bureaucracy. Some argue the legislature should legalize the extra powers and influences given to the Civil Service during the initial Martial Law period. They note the increase in efficiency and implementation of government policy. However, others fear that legitimizing these powers will challenge local authorities and slowly build a situation where the National Assembly will find its powers and ability to effect change eroded."
 Ayub_East_Pakistan.1.d:0 "One of the pressing issues facing Pakistan since independence has been the continued struggle between the eastern and western wings. East Pakistan has the largest population, the most homogenous ethnic group, and the least representation in the military and civil service of all Pakistani groups. Leaders in East Pakistan have advocated provincialism and accused the government of discrimination and exploitive practices. With a firm government now in control, we must decide whether to firmly assert the power of the center and target dissidents for being anti-Pakistani. Or if it may be better to build national identity through reaching out and addressing some of the legitimate concerns of Bengalis, such as military representation and respecting Bengali heritage."
 One_Unit_60s.1.d:0 "The Pakistan government merged all the provinces of the western wing into one province called West Pakistan under the One Unit policy. This was meant to promote national unity, increase efficiency, and help offset the ethnic homogeny and larger population of East Pakistan. However, since One Unit has been instituted there has been much criticism, especially among the leaders of the former provinces of the NWFP and Sindh. They argue One Unit encourages Punjabi domination and silences their voices, along with the Balochis of Baluchistan. One Unit has the advantage of equalizing the two wings of the country, strengthening the Federal government, and has encouraged the integration of peoples across West Pakistan, but the increasing agitation from opponents indicates it remains unpopular to the people. The government must decide to dismantle One Unit or maintain it."
 PAK_Frontier.1.d:0 "Since even before independence, Pathan nationalist leaders, led by the charismatic Abdul Ghaffar Khan have called for independence or enough autonomy to basically become independent. These leftist activists, now largely members of the recently banned National Awami Party (NAP), continue their agitations and are rumored to be in league with Afghan government agents. Recently they have complained harshly against the government and the role of the military. The government has received two proposals. One is to continue the arrests and detentions of senior NAP leaders, though this tends to agitate urban workers in Peshawar. The other approach is to instead release NAP leaders and not let them become political martyrs for their supporters. Instead we can focus on galvanizing the rural majority to support the government."
 PAK_Restore_Provinces.1.d:0 "With the restoration of provinces, new provincial elections were held. Members of regional political parties, including many advocates for provincial autonomy won seats across the provinces, setting up confrontation with the center and provinces. The government will have a much more difficult time in governing efficiently or using the Civil Service to oversee changes in the provinces. One proposal from the cabinet is to increase development funds for provincial governments to convince them to be more cooperative. However, others in the cabinet fear such an effort will just be a waste of time and it will just take a little time to normalize exchanges with the provinces."

 Rahman_Victorious.1.d:0 "Pakistanis in several cantonments across West and East Pakistan awoke to the sight of military vehicles and heavily armed troops patrolling the streets. Armed troops also occupied key government buildings in Islamabad and Dacca. However, this apparent coup quickly unraveled. By the afternoon, a large column of Pakistani troops from Rawalpindi entered the capital, after a brief standoff, they removed the rebel soldiers from government buildings. At the same time, the troops occupying the cantonments had returned to their barracks. By the evening, President Mujibur Rahman addressed the nation, he revealed a plot led by some reactionary officers had been thwarted by senior officers and patriotic soldiers who refused to betray the constitution. He announced a temporary curfew, calling for calm as those involved with the plot are being taken into custody."
 Rahman_Victorious.2.d:0 "Massive crowds of Pakistanis took to the streets in Dacca, Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi. They are rallying in support of the government and democracy. The protestors are expressing their support for the state following a recent failed coup attempt. During the rallies, leading politicians from the ruling coalition addressed the crowds, praising the response of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Some of the speakers however made inflammatory comments, condemning elements of the military for opposing democracy. Paramilitary and military personnel did not deploy to support the local authorities in controlling the crowds, maintaining a low profile."
 Rahman_Victorious.3.d:0 "President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced the appointment of a military tribunal to try and investigate the recent coup attempt. In his remarks, he praised the patriotism and professionalism of the forces who acted in defence of the state. He called on the media to halt its speculation on the incident and condemned recent editorials suggesting a problem of Bonapartism within the Army. General Tikka Khan will head the tribunal, with Major General Zia ul-Haq being accused as the ringleader of the failed coup attempt. Pakistanis have nervously awaited more information on the alleged plot. Dozens of officers are in detention and the military is conspicuously absent from the streets to avoid inflaming the population. Analysts believe the President decided to allow the military to rule on the case after facing immense pressure from senior military officers in recent days."
 Rahman_Victorious.4.d:0 "General Tikka Khan is prepared to render a ruling on the trial of Pakistani officers involved in the failed coup plot. The trial and investigation revealed though the plot failed, there are many Pakistani officers who view socialism with suspicion. Many in the public would like to see the summarily dismissal of all officers suspected to be involved in the plot, along with long prison sentences for those who carried it out. However, within the military, there is a sense that a widescale crackdown would bring insult to the institution and serve the interests of anti-military elements. They would prefer to see the main plotters be dismissed from service, while all other suspected plotters be returned to duty. General Tikka Khan must weigh the impact on the nation vs the impact on the Army."
 Rahman_Victorious.5.d:0 "The verdict reach by the Military Tribunal led by General Tikka Khan was recently released. General Zia ul-Haq, along with several other senior officers, will be sentenced to a military prison for ten years and discharged from the service. They are convicted of attempting a coup to overthrow the government. The court took note that armed violence was not used by the plotters in justifying the prison term. Dozens of other officers, convicted of being aware of the plot are to be immediately discharged from the military. The tribunal noted that though these officers did not participate in the attempt, their failure to report the plot made them unfit for the military. The President thanked the tribunal for completing its duty."
 Rahman_Victorious.6.d:0 "The media and public have reacted favorably to the recent ruling by the Military Tribunal. Editorials are praising General Tikka Khan for holding the coup plotters to task, stating the decision shows a new maturity from the military. The President also spoke in favor of the verdict, praising the military for its devotion to the constitution. However, within the military, there is said to be some discontent. Some feel the prison sentences are too harsh and blacken the reputation of the officer corps. Most are angered by the removal of so many promising officers. These men were removed based on weak physical evidence or for obeying their superiors. Regardless, Pakistan will look to move on from the affair."
 Rahman_Victorious.7.d:0 "The verdict reached by the Military Tribunal led by General Tikka Khan was recently released. General Zia ul-Haq, along with several other senior officers, are to be dismissed from service and placed under house arrest for the foreseeable future. They are convicted of attempting a coup to overthrow the government. Dozens of other officers, accused of knowing the details of the plot but failing to inform the government, will not be punished. The tribunal noted the attempted coup did not result in violence or deaths, but those who participated should be drummed out of service. In terms of the accused accomplices, the tribunal cited a lack of evidence beyond testimonies."
 Rahman_Victorious.8.d:0 "The media and public have reacted negatively to the recent ruling by the Military Tribunal. Editorials accuse the military of protecting its own interests over the needs and wishes of the nation. Some underground anti-military pamphlets are circulating, calling on the people to prepare themselves to defend the government from future military schemes. Within the military, the verdict is seen as a just, even-handed response. Army personnel are now returning to the streets in uniform and with their heads held high. President Mujibur Rahman notably did not release a statement or address the nation after the verdict. Many believe the President and senior political leaders are infuriated by the verdict, seeing it as a direct challenge to civil authority."

 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.1.d:0 "Pakistanis woke up to the sight of troops and tanks across cities in West Pakistan and in some cantonment areas in East Pakistan. Government buildings were occupied while reports indicate the homes of leading politicians are currently surrounded by troops. Other politicians are said to be under house arrest. Soon after, the Army announced it had taken control of the country from President Mujibur Rahman. The leader of this coup is a young Major General named Zia ul-Haq. It appears the coup was planned below the upper echelons and it is rumored these senior officers area also under detention. In his statement, President Zia stated the nation was being moved towards atheism and provincial politics which would lead to the destruction of the nation. General Zia promised new elections would be held soon. However, it is unknown how much control the military has in East Pakistan where much of the forces there are Bengali."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.2.d:0 "In the aftermath of the military coup, the situation in Pakistan is at a tense stalemate. West Pakistan is largely under the control of the military, who enjoy support from the conservative and religious segments who long opposed the move towards socialism in the country. Within the military, Zia has garnered support among much of the officer corps who oppose the rise of alternative military forces. However, the Awami League managed to retain control in East Pakistan as the Bengali forces within the Army refused to join General Zia. With the situation at a stalemate, General Zia dispatched a group of officers and political allies to Dacca for talks with the Awami League and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.3.d:0 "After intense negotiations, the Awami League and military government announced an agreement had been reached. Out of respect for the sentiments of West Pakistanis and East Pakistanis, it was agreed that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Awami League will remain in control of East Pakistan and the military would not try to seize control of the eastern wing. The Awami League agreed to allow the military regime to govern West Pakistan until a final agreement can be reached. Essentially both sides agreed to maintain the status quo. Most Pakistanis appear to have accepted the situation, hoping civil war can be avoided."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.4.d:0 "Following the agreement with the Awami League and its essential removal from West Pakistan, Zulfikar Bhutto is by far the most popular politician in the country. General Zia recently sent representatives to Bhutto asking for his intentions. A defiant Bhutto mentioned his disapproval of the coup and called for the restoration of democracy. General Zia and his top generals must decide if they should allow Bhutto to leave his current house arrest and setup a constitutional assembly for the country. He would create a new constitution that preserves the Islamic principles of the country and end provincial conflicts. Bhutto could be convinced to keep Zia as Army Chief and not target the coup leaders if given power. The other option would be to keep Bhutto detained and investigate him for alleged corruption charges as the military government continues to govern."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.5.d:0 "Following his release from house arrest, Zulfikar Bhutto called on all political parties to come together for a constitutional assembly. The Pakistan Army is currently standing down, lifting martial law regulations and returning control to local civil authorities. Bhutto is calling for a new constitution that will resolve the outstanding issues and prevent the disunity that prevails across the country. To establish a united Pakistan, Bhutto has invited the Awami League to attend and politically reunite the two wings of the country."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.6.d:0 "The Awami League shocked the nation by refusing to attend the Constitutional Assembly called for by Zulfikar Bhutto. They note Bhutto appears to be a military puppet and they how a leader of a minority party could be in charge of constitution meeting. This announcement has thrown a wrench at plans to unite Pakistan. Efforts by Bhutto to negotiate have failed and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced he would no longer accept the continued oppression of Bengalis. It appears the Awami League is now determined to achieve self-government for East Pakistan. Protests have erupted across East Pakistan with the people demanding independence and the withdrawal of the Pakistan military. Pakistani forces in East Pakistan are said to be staying in their barracks and minimizing contact with the broader public."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.7.d:0 "The Awami League refusal to attend the constitutional assembly caused a stalemate with Zulfikar Bhutto in control of West Pakistan and Mujibur Rahman in charge of East Pakistan. To break this stalemate, and end the increasing feeling of despair among Pakistanis, the Pakistan military announced plans to withdraw its forces from East Pakistan. This paves the way for a full separation. Those military personnel who wish to remain in East Pakistan will be allowed to stay on. However, the Army announced it would withdraw all equipment not nailed down from East Pakistan and call up reserves to replace those officers and troops who stay behind. Over the years a number of Bengalis have joined the military with many already stationed in East Pakistan, they will likely stay. Experts believe once the military completes the evacuation, separation will follow."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.8.d:0 "Addressing a crowded stadium, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman proclaimed the independence of Bangladesh. Across Dacca and what is now the former territory of East Pakistan, millions are said to have taken to the streets, with almost every home flying homemade Bangladesh flags. Later on, Rahman met with senior government and military officials from Pakistan who formally congratulated the people of Bangladesh and promised a new era of brotherly ties. Despite this public display of acceptance, both Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are bitter over this separation, with many blaming the other side for failing to compromise or make the decisions necessary to preserve Pakistan."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.9.d:0 "With Zulfikar Bhutto under arrest and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman still in control of East Pakistan, General Zia ul-Haq called a Corps Commanders Meeting to discuss the situation. During the high-level discussions, Zia was presented with two options on how to deal with the rising unrest, especially among urban leftists and Bhutto sympathizers. Once these groups are handled, then the government can deal with Mujibur Rahman and East Pakistan. One option calls for an aggressive military crackdown. The generals nickname it the stick approach. The other option is to offer concessions and compromise with the major political groupings in the country in order to govern in cooperation."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.10.d:0 "The military government announced it would soon bring charges related to corruption and murder against Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. This stunning news comes months after the major political leader was put in house arrest following a military coup by the Pakistan Army. Bhutto managed to release a written statement condemning the charges as trumped up and without merit. He called for the people of Pakistan to continue resisting anti-democratic forces and save the country. When asked about the charges by the international media, General Zia stated he had no comment as the judiciary is not under his influence. He stated the courts of Pakistan and the rule of law will determine the fate of Bhutto. There are reports of hit and  run attacks against military patrols in Karachi, sparking rumors of armed resistance..."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.11.d:0 "The Pakistan government under General Zia announced it had reached an agreement with the Awami League led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Zia recently sought to depose Rahman in a military coup, but the Bengali leader managed to escape to Dacca and take control of East Pakistan. The two sides agreed to exchange government and military personnel, this will allow East Pakistani residents living in West Pakistan to return home, and vice versa. It also calls for the complete withdrawal of Pakistani military equipment from the country, General Zia insists this belongs to Pakistan. After the equipment and personnel are exchanged, Pakistan will accept the independence of Bangladesh. Many across both West and East Pakistan welcome the news as they are fed up with the constant political conflicts and disorder."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.12.d:0 "Pakistan confirmed its commitment to its recent agreement with Bangladesh by publishing its evacuation plan. Military personnel and government officials wishing to be repatriated back to Pakistan are to do so as soon as possible. The government is also dispatching and hiring transportation services to ensure the speedy removal of military and state equipment purchased for the state of Pakistan. The government claims it will complete the evacuation in roughly three months. The Pakistan government, responding to criticism that it is leaving nothing for Bangladesh, noted it would hire and arrange the evacuation of East Pakistanis wishing to leave West Pakistan during this same period. General Zia expressed his desire for future brotherly ties."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.13.d:0 "General Zia signed a document with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in Dacca confirming the independence of Bangladesh. The two men, former rivals who had engaged in months of political stalemate, warmly embraced each other after the signing. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman expressed his joy for the people of Bangladesh, though he noted it took much hardship for it to happen. General Zia simply expressed his desire for both nations to continue on the path of Islam and the vision of Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The next day, the two men were to meet for talks and General Zia must decide if he will take the opportunity to offer Bangladesh an alliance, or to just leave the situation as is."
 Pakistan_Alt_1973_Coup.14.d:0 "During private talks held between Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Pakistani leader General Zia ul-Haq, the Pakistani strongman called for the two sides to sign an alliance. Zia noted Pakistan and Bangladesh are both descendants of the Pakistan movement and their people should maintain close ties. Although a unified state is not possible, a new friendship based on mutual respect and independent development could make the two states the powerhouse alliance in the region. Rahman thanked General Zia but stated he must discuss the matter with the cabinet. The response from the cabinet appears to lean towards rejecting the offer. They note General Zia was the one who sought to overthrow the Awami League which led to these current circumstances and fear the people would feel betrayed. Others however, especially those connected to the religious parties, note such an alliance could confirm Bangladesh has a major place both regionally and internationally. Mujibur Rahman must decide how to respond…"


 Yahya_Khan.1.d:0 "President Ayub Khan announced he could no longer preside over a nation in turmoil. He stated his goal had always been the progress and advancement of the people of Pakistan but this was no longer possible. Instead, he has handed power over to General Yahya Khan, his protégé. Khan quickly proclaimed Martial Law and named himself Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). He announced the deployment of troops across the country to restore law and order. Once that was achieved, new, democratic elections will be helped. The general reaction has been cautious optimism. Many in the country wish to see the restoration of democracy but were growing weary of the increasing rise in crime."
 Yahya_Khan.2.d:0 "To better coordinate the security situation in Pakistan and prepare for elections, CMLA Yahya Khan convened a National Security Council (NSC), meant to bring together the top civilian and military security officials. The move is being welcomed by observers who see this as an attempt by the military government to govern with civilians, giving them a broader perspective on the situation facing the country. During the first meeting the NSC lauded the successful restoration of law and order across Pakistan and stated its support for plans to organize new elections for the country as soon as possible."
 Yahya_Khan.3.d:0 "The CMLA General Yahya Khan announced the promulgation of Legal Framework Order no. 1970. This order establishes the framework for the upcoming elections and officially de-establishes the One Unit scheme, restoring the original four provinces of what was Wests Pakistan. The move is being welcomed by many who saw the One Unit scheme as skewing development to the Punjabi majority in West Pakistan and leaving the other regions and ethnic groups behind. In terms of the election, the order promises universal suffrage, proportional representation, giving the eastern wing a majority of seats, and only a simple majority required to amend the constitution. It stipulated that the elected National Assembly will have four months to finalize a new constitution for Pakistan. "

 Tashkent_Bhutto.1.d:0 "Zulfiqar Bhutto had served several years in the cabinet of Ayub Khan. Portraying himself as a staunch loyalist to the General and patriot, he quickly became a trusted confidant. The highly educated Oxford grad soon became Foreign Minister, bring his charisma and articulate speaking to international bodies. Within the government, Bhutto led the hawks on Kashmir and pushed to initiate operations in Kashmir. The resulting war ended in a stalemate and during peace talks in Tashkent, Bhutto publicly denounced the treaty. Upon returning to Pakistan, his relationship with the government was beyond repair and he submitted his resignation. Over the next few months Bhutto addressed large crowds, articulating his plans for a new party that would embrace a Pakistan of Islam, Democracy, and Socialism. He recently announced the formation of this party, called the Pakistan Peoples Party or PPP with him as chairman. It brings together the leading socialist and communist leaders of Pakistan."
 Delhi_Unrest.1.d:0 "The senior leadership of the Pakistan military was stunned following a recent address of officers at the Staff College in Quetta. When the Director of Military Operations addressed the assembled officers, most being majors, he faced jeers and angry outbursts. There are reports of similar types of outbursts across different cantonments, but not to the scale seen in Quetta. The lower ranked officers believe the senior military officers were largely incompetent during the war and they demand reforms along with resignations. It will take time to rebuild discipline and restore confidence in our institution. Military Intelligence will be directed to monitor the situation and intervene if any young officers begin planning more overt action against the institution or state."

 DemRahman1970.0.d:0 "Once again millions of Pakistanis took to the polls for elections to determine which party would rule Pakistan and who will be President. Former President and father of the current constitution, Ayub Khan announced his retirement from politics and will not participate. However, the young Zulfikar Ali Bhutto appears to be leading his own party, the Pakistan Peoples Party and a centrist coalition against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his leftist coalition of socialist parties. Although Bhutto and Rahman both advocate socialism, Bhutto advocates for an Islamic Socialism which Rahman supporters dismiss as too watered down. For parties at the center and right leaning, Bhutto appears the lesser of two evils, especially as he supports a strong center, however, there is also a ground-swell of support for not just the socialism of Rahman but also his advocacy of an almost non-existent center and greater provincial autonomy, especially for East Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.1.d:0 "In a tense National Assembly session, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman spoke in favor of a newly presented bill calling for the implementation of the Six Points for East Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman unveiled the Six Points several years earlier as a series of policies meant to secure the rights and dignity of East Pakistan. At the time, West Pakistanis and federalists condemned the proposals for essentially granting East Pakistan independence. After his speech, a fiery debate took place with many in the opposition, especially representatives from West Pakistan, condemned the new bill as writing the death warrant for united Pakistan. Many government representatives and Bengali members spoke in favor of the bill, calling it a restoration of Bengali honor."
 DemRahman1970.2.d:0 "News of the Six Points bill in the National Assembly has seen Pakistan plunged into unrest. Across West Pakistan, many have taken to the street to condemn Sheikh Mujibur Rahman as a Bengali agent working to destroy the nation. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the leader of the opposition spoke at some of the rallies in Karachi, stating he understood the feeling of anguish among the people. In Dacca, Bengalis came in massive crowds celebrating the bill. Many feel Pakistan had treated them as second-class citizens and the new bill would rectify the problem."
 DemRahman1970.3.d:0 "The political fallout of the Six Points bill reached a critical point when all the West Pakistani representatives walked out of the National Assembly and flew out of Dacca. They were led out by the opposition leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Upon landing in Karachi, Bhutto declared they would not return to the parliament unless the government withdrew the Six Points bill. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was defiant, stating he would not be cowed from carrying out the will of the people. He noted the remaining members of the assembly can finish passing the bill without the opposition. Analysts note that without the boycotting parliamentarians, the country appears clearly divided."
 DemRahman1970.4.d:0 "Since the new constitution came into effect, the military accelerated its efforts to better recruit proportional to the ethnic makeup of the country. As a result, there are far more Bengalis in the armed forces than previously. This has made the current political climate more difficult. There had been discussions within the Army to perhaps intervene and seize control over the situation. However, it became clear that such an act might instigate major mutiny or an insurrection by Bengali forces. Considering many of these soldiers and officers are based in East Pakistan, any order to seize the National Assembly could result in disaster. The GHQ informed the opposition leaders that the military cannot act positively given the circumstances."
 DemRahman1970.5.d:0 "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and a delegation of West Pakistani parliamentarians, military leaders, and civil servants met with their Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his own delegation. After a series of discussions, the two sides agreed on a division of assets and the repatriation of West Pakistani personnel from East Pakistan. It is clear Rahman will not compromise on his Six Points and such a passage would be intolerable to the people of West Pakistan. This private agreement paves the way for Rahman to declare Bengali independence and end the united Pakistan experiment. The repatriation is already quietly occurring to make the transition as smooth as possible."
 DemRahman1970.6.d:0 "In a stunning announcement, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has proclaimed the independence of East Pakistan as Bangladesh. He gave the announcement to cheering crowds. Bengalis across the new nation have started to fly homemade flags. In West Pakistan, now just Pakistan, the mood is despondent but muted. Many had expected this announcement for weeks and at this point many feel it is good riddance. Not many Pakistanis remain in the former East Pakistan and they are expected home soon. The Pakistan military has instituted martial law and handed power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the head of the largest political party in the country. He has promised to restore order and establish a new constitution for Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.7.d:0 "The loss of Bangladesh is a major blow to the Pakistan military. Nearly one-third of its personnel were Bengali and the vast majority have joined the new state. The military will need to rebuild its ranks, but thankfully there are not only ample reserves but a strong tradition of military service among many communities in Pakistan. Regardless, it will take time to restore our capacities and re-establish certain facilities. The new Chief Martial Law Administrator, Zulifkar Ali Bhutto has pledged his complete support for the efforts to restore the Pakistan military to its former glory."
 DemRahman1970.8.d:0 "When President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman supported a proposed bill to adopt the Six Points for East Pakistan it led to intense criticism from West Pakistanis. However, after the initial tension, the two sides agreed to amend the proposed bill in a way that both sides find beneficial. Ultimately, these discussions bore fruit and the government will soon present an amended version of the bill that will pass. Neither side is said to be wholly satisfied with the agreement, but considering the circumstances, it is better than the alternative."
 DemRahman1970.9.d:0 "The newly amended bill on the Six Points past the National Assembly with little debate. The bill revamps the political structure of Pakistan. West Pakistan will become Pakistan and have a separate federal parliament than from the planned establishment of an autonomous East Pakistan. East Pakistan will enjoy its own parliament, defence force, and development policy. The two wings will now be connected through a shared foreign policy and economic ties. Both wings will have their own executives, with disputes resolved through dialogue. The initial reaction of the people in both wings is disappointment, but an acceptance that this solution was needed to stop the decades of political problems plaguing the country since independence."
 DemRahman1970.10.d:0 "Since the announcement regarding the establishment of East Pakistan was announced, federal employees and military personnel were asked to pick which federal system they wanted to join. Either Pakistan or East Pakistan. Since then, there has been extensive effort for the moving of Pakistanis from East Pakistan ahead of the establishment of East Pakistan. At the same time East Pakistanis are also being shifted back home. One newspaper noted a flight of East Pakistani military officers exited a plane in Dacca, only to see Pakistani officers immediately board the same plane to return back to Pakistan. Unfortunately the repatriation is leading to some issues, especially for families where one spouse is from Pakistan and the other from East Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.11.d:0 "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who will take control of Pakistan once East Pakistan is established concluded talks with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who will head East Pakistan. The two men agreed to a division of national assets between the two sides. This includes the division of cash reserves, resources, and the military. Both men were positive after the talks and expressed their satisfaction over the new Pakistan about to form. The agreement was financially generous to East Pakistan and many interpret this as a gesture from Pakistan that despite the changed status, they still see East Pakistan as a part of united Pakistan."
 DemRahman1970.12.d:0 "After months of negotiations and preparations, East Pakistan finally began functioning as an autonomous province of Pakistan. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed the people of East Pakistan stating his promise for the restoration of Bengali dignity and honor was complete. He stated Pakistan has emerged stronger and more united with this decision and both wings will now prosper together and not at the expense of each other. Large crowds gathered to watch a parade which included cultural floats and a military parade of soldiers from the newly established East Pakistan Army. In Pakistan the reaction was more mute. The new leader of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto stated he would maintain the state as is until the next elections. At this point many in Pakistan accepted this result was inevitable so there has been a quiet acceptance."
 DemRahman1970.13.d:0 "Since the last constitution came into effect, a much stronger effort was made to better recruit ethnic groups proportional to their representation within Pakistan. Although many senior officers were Pakistanis, there were a large number of young Bengali officers and soldiers. The vast majority of whom signed up to join the East Pakistan Army. We are also committed to hand the East Pakistan military its share of our equipment. This leaves a big headache for GHQ who suddenly find a lack of manpower and assets to call upon. However, the provinces of Pakistan were historically a major source of military manpower across the subcontinent and many volunteers can eagerly be found. More importantly, Pakistan does have ample reserves as well. Pakistan will be fine but restructuring the military to tap these sources will take time and effort."
 DemRahman1970.14.d:0 "As part of the initiative of President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to transform Pakistan into a socialist economy, the national assembly passed the Nationalization of Essential Industries Act. This bill calls for the nationalization of the petroleum and electric industries. The government argued these are vital industries that should not put citizens at the mercy of capitalist price gauging or under the control of private corporations. With the bill passed, the President directed federal resources to begin the process of bringing these companies under government supervision."

 Dem_Ayub65.1.d:0 "The people of Pakistan went to the polls to elect a new National Assembly and President for Pakistan. This is the first election under the new constitution. The people of Pakistan have two choices. They can either go with President Ayub Khan, who established the new constitution and guided the nation to these elections. He currently controls an alliance of centrist and right leaning parties. Or they can go with the fiery Bengali politician Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who leads a leftist coalition. Ayub Khan embraces a capitalistic development plan and strong central government. Mujibur Rahman wishes to curtail worker exploitation, bring socialism, and expand provincial autonomy."
 Dem_Ayub65.2.d:0 "Pakistan Television (PTV) started its first broadcast last night. The new state television plans on delivering news reports, cultural programs, and entertainment for all citizens. President Ayub Khan in a press release stated his hope the new media would help unite the people of Pakistan and show the world all the beauty that lies within the nation. Although the number of televisions in the country is low, experts believe that this new media will soon become widespread in time."
 Dem_Ayub65.3.d:0 "A senior American cabinet member met with President Ayub Khan. He stated the United States would appreciate help in its ongoing conflict in Vietnam. He stated the United States was looking for a commitment of at least one infantry division. In exchange the United States can provide economic support, equipment for two infantry divisions and half an armoured division. The people of Pakistan are generally sympathetic to the anti-colonial struggle of the Vietnamese and would not view our involvement positively. However, the military would no doubt really appreciate the extra equipment. However, there would likely be discontent among the junior officers and soldiers over the foreign deployment."
 Dem_Ayub65.4.d:0 "Pakistan President Ayub Khan informed us he could not provide an infantry division for combat duty in Vietnam. Instead he offered to send a medical unit. However, as we have no need for such services, we declined the request. This is a setback to our efforts at internationalizing Vietnam as a global conflict against communism. Some of our allies in Congress will be sure to point out that despite our history of aid to Pakistan, they appear reluctant to return the favor and aid us. The Pakistanis are mostly worried about their own conflicts in the region and the risk of domestic backlash if they sent troops."
 Dem_Ayub65.5.d:0 "President Ayub Khan informed us he would dispatch an infantry division for Vietnam. He stated his top military officers are already considering which unit to send and state Pakistan is proud to continue the historical legacy of South Asian military deployments abroad to ensure global security. His government will soon release a statement to the public explaining the decision was based on existing ties with the United States and a desire to aid the Vietnamese people against the evils of Soviet-style communism. We will soon give orders to dispatch the promised arms and cash to the Pakistani government."
 Dem_Ayub65.6.d:0 "Despite some large demonstrations by university students, the government of Pakistan confirmed an infantry division was embarking to deploy in Vietnam. The force is meant to aid in the security of Asia against a violent, European communist ideology. The Pakistanis are painstakingly avoiding criticism of all communism to avoid antagonizing China. Ever since the government announced its intentions, there have been protests by leftists and religious activists. Both accuse the government of supporting Western imperialism and selling Pakistani lives for cash. The Pakistan military appears supportive, but privately it seems many officers and soldiers worked hard to avoid being deployed abroad. Regardless, the Pakistan government remains committed and has refused to state what the American government is providing Pakistan in exchange for its help."

 KASHMIR_60s.1.d:0 "The Pakistani government has asked us to hold talks on the Kashmir crisis. It is likely they will seek the implementation of the UN resolutions. However, we can certainly see if they are interested in perhaps reaching a compromise. Some senior officials believe the current situation in Kashmir is not tolerable as a long-term solution and what happens in that state may negatively affect the wider Indian Union. They also fear the continued tension hinders the economy and international reputation of India. They believe we should hold the talks. Other members of the cabinet argue Kashmir is an integral part of India, it is not a matter for Pakistan or the international community at all. Indeed, Pakistan itself is the occupier and they are only acting like this to prevent their inevitable defeat. We must decide to hold talks or not to."
 KASHMIR_60s.2.d:0 "The Prime Minister and his delegation of senior diplomatic and military advisors have held several days of talks with a Pakistani delegation at the hill station of Murree. As predicted, the Pakistanis appeared focused on implementing the UN resolutions and arranging for a plebiscite in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir decide to either join India or Pakistan. Both sides agreed independence is not a viable option for Kashmir. With round two of talks about to begin, we must decide on an approach. One option is to call for the current border to be made permanent, with both sides recognizing the others sovereignty. The other option could be to propose a partition on strategic and communal lines. Pakistan would receive the Kashmir Valley, but we would retain Jammu and Ladakh. Finally, we can offer to implement the plebiscite and leave it to the people of Kashmir. Or we can just declare the talks failed and end it."
 KASHMIR_60s.3.d:0 "We are holding extensive talks with the Indian leadership. After much wrangling and discussion, they have given us a stance on Kashmir. They suggest making the current ceasefire line in Kashmir the permanent border. Pakistan and India would then renounce any claims to all of Kashmir. The normalization of the border would then be the basis of a renewed relationship between India and Pakistan. After the Indian presentation, the Pakistani leadership met privately to discuss a response. Two perspectives emerged during the fiery debate. One group saw the proposal as a sensible end to the dispute and a way to normalize Indo-Pakistan relations. Another group viewed it as a humiliating betrayal to the people of both Kashmir and Pakistan. They argue the talks should be ended and India be brought to the United Nations."
 KASHMIR_60s.4.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced the end of the Kashmir Conflict following the high-level talks in Murree. Pakistan and India agreed to make the ceasefire line in Kashmir the permanent border. The government stated the normalization of the border will lead to long-term peace, prosperity, and the reunion of Kashmiri people through a peaceful border. However, this optimistic statement was met by strong criticism from the Urdu newspapers and a lukewarm response from the English newspapers. Many articles criticized the government for betraying Kashmir to India and abandoning the vision of Pakistan. Across the nation thousands took to the streets to protest the government decision. Some religious leaders were detained by local police for calling for revolution. There are rumors of unrest among officers in the military who felt the government caved into Indian demands."
 KASHMIR_60s.5.d:0 "The Indian government announced the end of the Kashmir Conflict following the high-level talks in Murree. India and Pakistan agreed to make the ceasefire line in Kashmir the permanent border. In its statement, the government noted the animosity and threat of armed violence will soon dissipate and the people of India can look forward to more peace and prosperity. The current status of Kashmir within the Indian constitution will soon be adjusted to introduce Kashmir as a proper state within the Indian Union. Although the press has largely supported the government, viewing the agreement as a victory for it, there are some more radical publications which argued all of Kashmir should be part of India and the government had surrendered the land stolen by Pakistan in 1949 with the initial ceasefire agreement. Regardless of these criticisms, the agreement remains largely popular domestically and internationally India is viewed as the victor."
 KASHMIR_60s.6.d:0 "We are holding extensive talks with the Indian leadership. After much wrangling and discussion, they have given us a stance on Kashmir. They have suggested partitioning Kashmir along communal and strategic lines. In this proposal, both sides would renounce claims on the each other in Kashmir, Pakistan would receive the Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar. In exchange, India would retain control of Jammu and they insisted for strategic reasons they must also control Ladakh. The Pakistani leadership then met privately to discuss the proposal, with two potential responses emerging. One group sees the proposal as very advantageous, Pakistan would achieve its goal of liberating the Kashmir Valley. Jammu had a Hindu majority and Ladakh was an acceptable price. The other group however, argued the offer showed India was fearful of the UN being involved to force a plebiscite and Pakistan should end talks and take its chances at the UN for all of Kashmir."
 KASHMIR_60s.7.d:0 "An Azad Kashmir Infantry battalion from Pakistan entered Srinagar to take control of the city from the Indian government for Pakistan. In a smart ceremony, the two sides conducted a joint flag lowering and raising ceremony. The last Indian troops and officials left with full honors as per the recently agreed Indo-Pakistan Partition Plan that was signed during the Murree Conference on Kashmir. As Pakistani troops and officials moved into the Kashmir Valley, many Kashmiris followed close behind, hoping to reconnect with family separated during the first Kashmir War. Although some religious leaders and nationalists condemned the agreement for not securing all of Kashmir, many Pakistanis welcomed the move and see it as a favorable compromise which completed the promise Pakistan made to the Muslims of the Kashmir Valley. Reports of panic and communal clashes along the new border with Jammu did not dampen the news for Pakistanis."
 KASHMIR_60s.8.d:0 "Following the Murree Conference on Kashmir, many Indians, especially on the far right and far left were upset with the Indo-Pakistan Partition Plan. Those on the right opposed it as a surrender to Pakistan of sovereign Indian land. For the left, the agreement to partition along largely communal lines was condemned as against the spirit of Indian secularism. Regardless, the Indian government and military largely succeeded in handing over the Kashmir Valley with honor. Incidents of communal violence along the new border in Jammu were minimized thanks to the action of Indian forces in the area. Many Hindu Kashmiri refugees from the First Kashmir War have launched protests and called the agreement a betrayal and legitimization to Pakistani violence. Regardless, many now hope that Pakistan and India can transform their relationship from one of animosity to one of friendship."
 KASHMIR_60s.9.d:0 "We are holding extensive talks with the Indian leadership. After much wrangling and discussion, they have given us a stance on Kashmir. Much to the shock of the Pakistani leaders, the Indian government offered to implement the UN resolutions and allow the organization to hold a plebiscite on the final status of Kashmir. The Pakistani leadership met to discuss the unbelievable turn of events. As the Indians were offering what Pakistan had demanded from the beginning, there was not much to discuss. The Pakistanis returned and agreed to the Indian offer. Both nations dispatched their top diplomats to the United Nations in order to prepare the ground for implementing the resolutions."
 KASHMIR_60s.10.d:0 "Pakistan hosted India for high level talks at the hill station in Murree for the Murree Conference on Kashmir. The talks unfortunately ended in failure. Neither side appeared willing or prepared to make compromises on their stance. When the Indian delegation returned home its members were quoted as saying Pakistan harbored unrealistic expectations and exhibited a naked desire for Indian territory. The Pakistani government released a statement blaming India for a lack of flexibility and a desire to perpetuate an unlawful occupation. The Pakistan Foreign Ministry announced its intentions to present a resolution to the United Nations calling for sanctions until India agrees to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir."

 UN_KASHMIR.1.d:0 "The Pakistani government dispatched its top diplomats to the United Nations in order to present a resolution demanding India implement UN Resolution 47 or face economic sanctions from the international community. The Pakistan delegation noted India had largely refused to discuss Kashmir or offer any realistic avenue to a just resolution. Because of this, Pakistan is now turning to the United Nations for justice and resolution. The resolution is expected to reach the Security Council and Pakistan is hoping both the United States and Soviet Union chose to not veto it. Indian diplomats are already talking with both nations, emphasizing their position and opposition to what they call international blackmail."
 UN_KASHMIR.2.d:0 "A recent Pakistani resolution calling on India to implement UN Resolution 47, which calls for a plebiscite in Kashmir, or else face sanctions is currently being considered by diplomats of the Security Council. The Indian government has already expressed its desire for us to veto the resolution, saying if enacted, the economic sanctions would mostly hurt Indian trade partners. Some diplomats agree and state despite our friendship to Pakistan, sacrificing opportunities in India would be foolish. Other advisors point to Indian neutrality and rumored flirtations with the Soviet Union. They believe we should not use the veto, preserving our ties with Pakistan and demonstrating our commitment to the United Nations system we have spent so much time and energy establishing."
 UN_KASHMIR.3.d:0 "A recent Pakistani resolution calling on India to implement UN Resolution 47, which calls for a plebiscite in Kashmir, or else face sanctions is currently being considered by diplomats of the Security Council. The Indian government has already expressed its desire for us to veto the resolution, saying if enacted, the economic sanctions would mostly hurt Indian trade partners. Unlike Pakistan, India has at time proven to be open minded to our state and ideology. Vetoing may improve relations and help push India closer to our orbit. Other advisors, however, point out letting the resolution go on may help our ties with Pakistan, and give us more diplomatic clout with India. By not vetoing, we will pressure India into more firmly supporting the Soviet Union and avoid neutrality or a pro-Western orientation."
 UN_KASHMIR.4.d:0 "The American delegation at the Security Council announced the United States would veto the Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. Afterwards, American diplomats were quick to say how much they sympathized with the people of Kashmir and understood the frustration of Pakistan. However, they stated the UN was a place of international peace and on principle America could not endorse such a resolution which threatened a member state with sanctions if they failed to comply. The Pakistani delegation appeared quite openly dejected and the news has already sparked some anti-American editorials and protests."
 UN_KASHMIR.5.d:0 "During a recent Security Council meeting, the Soviet delegation indicated it would veto the recent Pakistan resolution on Kashmir. This marks a major blow to a recent diplomatic effort by Pakistan to reach a resolution on the Kashmir dispute. After the meeting, Soviet diplomats stated they felt the resolution appeared one sided. In Pakistan, the government is said to be furious over the setback, with opposition politicians blaming the government for the failed attempt. Anti-Soviet protests have erupted in major cities. The Indian government has announced its appreciation and thanks to the Soviets for stopping what they felt was a biased resolution."
 UN_KASHMIR.6.d:0 "After some adjustments in the wording, the resolution calling for the implementation of Resolution 47 by India passed. This new resolution, championed by Pakistan and its supporters, calls on us to implement the three stages outlined in resolution 47 to complete a plebiscite across the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. If we do not comply and agree to hold the plebiscite, the United Nations will place economic sanctions on our nation. However, the new wording makes the extent of sanctions vague. The cabinet is divided, some are advocating we implement Resolution 47 and hope Kashmir makes the right choice. Others argue the resolution is a blatant infringement on our sovereignty and the will of the Kashmiri people. They say we should refuse and take the sanctions. India is far too big of an economy to be sanctioned for a long period of time."
 UN_KASHMIR.7.d:0 "A defiant Indian government statement called the recent United Nations Security Council resolution illegal and a blatant violation of India sovereignty. The Indian government further added that the nation did not achieve its freedom from colonial exploitation only to be abused by the international community. The Pakistan government quickly condemned the Indian response and called on the international community to implement the sanctions. The United States and Soviet Union both expressed concern over the situation but did not specify plans on how or if they would put sanctions in response"
 UN_KASHMIR.8.d:0 "Our decision to reject the recent UN resolution has triggered many nations to implement some forms of economic sanctions on our country. However, the resolution only passed after the wording on the extent of sanctions was made vague. This means that though our economy will be severely hurt, the sanctions should not be as crippling as the Pakistanis hoped. The United Nations also stated the sanctions would immediately be lifted if we agree to hold a plebiscite as outlined in UN resolution 47. Many foreign and economic advisors predict these sanctions are not likely to be permanent and with patience we might even see them completely lifted."
 UN_KASHMIR.9.d:0 "As many of our experts predicted, the sanctions placed on us by the United Nations are being relaxed by many nations. It appears many nations are worried about losing opportunities of reaching our markets or securing valuable contracts from our government. There are still sanctions and they are having an impact, but these are being lessoned. Experts now predict a complete end to the sanctions can be expected in the long-term. The option to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir is still available and if implemented this would end all sanctions."
 UN_KASHMIR.10.d:0 "The Indian government announced it will implement UN resolution 47 and with Pakistan prepare the groundwork for a vote in Kashmir. The Indian government insisted this was not done out of coercion but after its own officials concluded such an election can be held. The Indian government added it would only complete the three-phase plan as long as Pakistan did not seek to violate or interfere with the electoral process. A United Nations force is quickly being assembled to secure the ceasefire line in Kashmir and lay the groundwork for the plebiscite and maintain peace in the region. The United Nations Secretary General in a statement welcomed the news but stated the implementation of resolution 47 would take time, patience, and cooperation to succeed."
 UN_KASHMIR.11.d:0 "A large United Nations force has arrived at the ceasefire line separating the Indian and Pakistan controlled areas of Kashmir. They have joined the already existing UN observation group who are providing valuable knowledge of the region. The UN forces are expected to hold separate briefings with both the Pakistani and Indian military commanders. The UN force is to see the withdrawal of Pakistani forces first, and then the withdrawal of Indian forces. Once this is achieved, the plebiscite will be held. During that vote, the people of Kashmir will finally decide their future destiny."
 UN_KASHMIR.12.d:0 "The Pakistan military in Kashmir has begun withdrawing its forces outside the historical boundaries of the Jammu and Kashmir Princely State. The Indian government initially tried to place its own local police in the area to maintain law and order with UN forces, however, the UN military command stated the Pakistani trained police in the area were capable of maintaining law and order. It noted resolution 80 equated Azad Kashmir forces with Jammu and Kashmir State forces. Pakistani officers and soldiers looked incredibly nervous as they loaded up their gear and began moving from the frontline. There are fears India may take this opportunity to renegade on the agreement and seize Kashmir, however, many analysts believe India would risk harming international peacekeepers with such an action."
 UN_KASHMIR.13.d:0 "As our forces begin their orderly withdrawal from Kashmir, as per the UN directives on implementing the plebiscite, some commanders are expressing concern for potential Indian traps. The UN resolution said the military forces of Pakistan and India were to withdraw, but we have local paramilitary forces who are not Pakistan Army regulars. In particular, the Gilgit Scouts were a militia force levied from locals. We can easily insist these forces remain in Kashmir as a law and order unit. The UN commander can easily be convinced. We will leave behind several of our top officers and soldiers with the Gilgit Scouts, along with extra equipment, in case there are any issues with the vote."
 UN_KASHMIR.14.d:0 "The Indian Army and Air Force have begun withdrawing their own forces from Kashmir. As per the resolution, they only began the process when it became clear Pakistan was completing their own withdrawal. The UN forces were impressed by the discipline and professionalism exhibited by the Indian forces as they left the frontlines. One Indian officer, speaking off the record explained his optimism that Indian troops would soon return once the Kashmiri people confirmed their desire to join India. Once the Indian withdrawal is confirmed, the United Nations must appoint a Plebiscite Overseer to ensure the election occurs without any issues."
 UN_KASHMIR.15.d:0 "The UN resolution is clear we must withdraw our regular military forces, however, we are to leave local police to ensure law and order. The Jammu and Kashmir Rifles were part of the Kashmir Princely State forces and we can easily convince the UN command to allow us to leave several battalions behind for security. With these troops we can leave extra equipment and some of our top officers and troops. These force would be a contingency to prevent Pakistani chicanery or any issues that may arise after the plebiscite."
 UN_KASHMIR.16.d:0 "The specially appointed United Nations Plebiscite Administrator, General Viscount Slim, arrived in Srinagar to oversee the plebiscite in Kashmir. The former British Indian Army commander is highly respected by officers in both India and Pakistan. General Slim in his initial statement said he hoped a free and fair election will lead to future peace and prosperity between India and Pakistan. He added that free and fair elections will be held as soon as possible. The original Plebiscite Administrator, Admiral Chester Nimitz was no longer available for the role."
 UN_KASHMIR.17.d:0 "Across Kashmir, the people came in huge numbers to vote. Although some expressed disappointment that independence was not an option in the vote, many were simply thankful to have the option. For many Kashmiris, this is a vital vote. Many are attracted to the idea of joining Pakistan and have a Muslim homeland. For others, especially among minority Hindus and Sikhs, India represents a secular dream of equality and prosperity. The people of both Pakistan and India are eagerly awaiting the results of this vote and what it means for the future of South Asia."
 UN_KASHMIR.18.d:0 "The United Nations Plebiscite Administrator announced that the people of Kashmir have voted to join Pakistan. Newspapers across Pakistan quickly fired new editions proclaiming the historic result. Spontaneous scenes of celebration occurred across all major cities and towns. The Pakistan government quickly released a statement expressing its satisfaction that the people of Kashmir were able to finally exercise their right to self-determination. The government also noted that minorities in Kashmir should have no fear and that Pakistan would protect all its citizens. The Indian government has yet to release a statement on the matter."
 UN_KASHMIR.19.d:0 "The United Nations announced the results of the vote. This is a shocking result and there are fears among our officials that Pakistan manipulated the results in their favor. Of more concern are reports that minorities across Kashmir are fleeing or preparing to leave before the Pakistanis arrive. It is clear that the Pakistanis cannot be trusted to protect these people from communal violence and indeed there are some reports of Muslim Kashmiris targeting non-Muslim neighbors. Thankfully, the Indian Army has informed us that the Jammu and Kashmir Rifles, still in Kashmir, can quickly secure Jammu and protect the minorities from further violence. Such an act will no doubt provoke the ire of Pakistan."
 UN_KASHMIR.20.d:0 "The United Nations Plebiscite Administrator announced that the people of Kashmir have voted to join India. Newspapers and radio broadcasts were quick to announce the exciting news. Spontaneous crowds emerged in cities across India to celebrate the result. The Indian government released a statement calling the vote a triumph for Indian democracy and secularism. It added that all Kashmiris will enjoy the same level of freedom as any other citizen. The Pakistan government has remained quiet but reports of angry protests and violence in Pakistani cities are being confirmed by international observers. There are some reports of the areas formerly controlled by Pakistan that the vote was rigged, leading to reports of agitation. Regardless, the result is being seen as a major Indian success."
 UN_KASHMIR.21.d:0 "From the results announced by the United Nations, it is clear that India engaged in massive manipulation to get the result they wanted. Already our Kashmiri brothers are desperately trying to flee to Pakistani territory in the hopes of avoiding renewed anti-Muslim Indian oppression. Fortunately, the Pakistan Army left behind the Gilgit Scouts for such a contingency. If we give the order, our troops should be able to secure Gilgit-Baltistan, protecting the Pakistani border and offering a safe haven for the refugees desiring freedom. The people of Pakistan are hurting from the results and are demanding action."

 PAK_Afghan_War.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union recently intervened in Afghanistan to prop up its communist ally. They are using armed force to brutally coerce Afghans into adopting an alien ideology and atheism. However, Afghanistan has long been a bastion of Islam and a proud nation. Many of its people are now fleeing to Pakistan and we have a moral obligation as Muslims to let them through. However, this influx of refugees will lead to a drain on our resources, but we will have to weather the storm."
 PAK_Afghan_War.2.d:0 "The Pakistani government is asking for economic and military aid in the face of a direct Soviet threat. Overnight the Pakistanis have become a frontline state against the Soviets. A failure to back the Pakistanis may open the door for more Chinese involvement or even worse, a Soviet expansion. The Pakistan military is desperate for new arms, specifically artillery and fighter aircraft. The government is more interested in economic aid that can help cope with the massive Afghan refugee crisis and spur an economic boom for the country. The Pakistanis note a military or economic crisis at this point could be detrimental to the entire region."
 PAK_Afghan_War.3.d:0 "Our brotherly friend Pakistan has asked us for extensive economic and military aid. Specifically, they are asking if we could contribute our own resources and those of the other Arab states to support them in the face of Soviet troops on their border. Pakistan insists they are the first bastion for the defense of Islam on its eastern flank and all Muslims should feel proud to aid them in their noble struggle. We can offer them economic subsidies to boost their economy and reduce the economic impact of the Afghan refugees flooding the country. In addition, we can provide military subsidies to enable Pakistan to purchase more weapons for Mujahideen."
 PAK_Afghan_War.4.d:0 "The Pakistani intelligence leadership has requested we expand Operation Cyclone, our clandestine program that purchases and transports arms for Mujahideen fighters in Pakistan. Currently, we purchase arms and send them to the Pakistan intelligence officers who distribute it among the different Mujahideen bands. We have a strong working relationship and are satisfied by the reports of operations on the ground. The Pakistanis claim to have a strong infrastructure for the distribution of arms and are capable of bringing even more arms and expand training missions to enable Mujahideen forces to conduct more advanced operations. Expanding the operation will weaken the Soviet military, but it will lead to more opportunities for corruption among low-level intelligence officers in Pakistan, however, not enough to hinder the operation."

 Zia_Era.1.d:0 "Karachi faces intense student protests. University students across the city continuously protest martial law restrictions and call for the restoration of democracy. Of a more dangerous strand are those students who claim that Zulfikar Bhutto was a martyr and those involved in his death should be arrested. The local Rangers and police have presented lists of prominent student leaders in the city. They would like the approval of the martial law government and local troops to arrest these leaders and hopefully disrupt the protests. However, such action may end up escalating the unrest. Some of the political advisors argue the potential risks are too high and we should just tolerate these protests until they naturally die down."
 Zia_Era.2.d:0 "The combined operations with Rangers and police to detain student protest leaders has not quelled the student uprisings. Instead, even more students have taken to the street, many outraged by the sight of armed troops storming campus buildings. University administrators note they are unable to control the protestors as these students no longer have an established leadership. Hopes that the arrests would stop some of the unrest sweeping the province has clearly failed. The students under detention sense their advantage and are refusing to cooperate in efforts to de-escalate the situation. We will have to wait it out."
 Zia_Era.3.d:0 "The combined operations with Rangers and police to detain student protest leaders has largely succeeded in reducing protests. It appears many students were spooked by the sudden arrests and are more willing to focus on their studies than engaging in protests. After interrogations, some of the student leaders have been released, with the promise they will not only refrain from organizing unrest but actively aid the university administration in curbing some of the more stubborn student groups. Martial Law Headquarters Karachi offered praises for the officers, soldiers, and policemen involved in these operations."
 Zia_Era.4.d:0 "Pakistan military power in Sindh is controlled by the V Corps, based in Karachi. General Zia ul-Haq has placed Lt. General S.M. Abbasi in command of V Corps and Military Governor of Sindh. The highly decorated artillery officer is expected to avoid playing political favorites and preventing corruption in the economic capital of the nation. Maintaining order will be a tough task as Karachi is a PPP stronghold and Zulfikar Bhutto is a native son of Sindh. Dealing with urban unrest over military rule along with PPP diehards and Sindhi nationalists are just a few of the challenges facing General Abbasi."
 Zia_Era.5.d:0 "The Martial Law Administration Sindh continues to deal with extensive resistance from PPP strongholds located throughout Sindh, but especially in Karachi and Larkana. From these locations the PPP organizes protests, strikes, and attacks on pro-government symbols or businesses. Some of the senior officers have drawn up a plan to launch an extensive crackdown to dismantle these PPP strongholds permanently. It would be a messy few months, but perhaps it can end this pestering problem. Some of the civilian advisors, however, note they have contacts within the PPP and would be willing to negotiate a ceasefire with the PPP. If we agree not to launch operations or provocations, they would likely agree to halt their disruptive operations and instead focus on their political outreach."
 Zia_Era.6.d:0 "Our efforts to crackdown on PPP strongholds have largely failed. Many PPP leaders remain at large as attempts to apprehend them often fail. Residents usually spread word of police or military movements, giving them plenty of time to flee or go underground. Not only were these operations ineffective, but many PPP activists have turned militant and pledged allegiance to the Al Zulfikar terrorist organization headed by the sons of Zulfikar Bhutto. They are already conducting hit and run attacks in Karachi and the group is expected to cause more problems across Sindh. Although the group is not expected to overthrow the regime, its actions will hinder economic development in Sindh."
 Zia_Era.7.d:0 "General Zia ul-Haq has placed Lt. General Ghulam Jilani Khan as Governor of Punjab and Martial Law Administrator of the province. Punjab, the largest province in Pakistan and base of its military recruitment and infrastructure must be firmly under the control of the regime. General Jilani is an infantry officer who served in World War II before joining the Pakistan Army after independence. He also served as the intelligence chief through much of the seventies, making him adept at local politics and establishing alliances. General Zia expects his new governor to not just keep the peace but help Zia establish relationships with Punjabi interests which can widen his base of support."
 Zia_Era.8.d:0 "The charismatic cavalry officer, Lt. General Fazle Haq, has accepted the appointment to be the Governor and Martial Law Administrator of the North-West Frontier Province. General Zia trusts General Fazle implicitly, as both men are armoured officers and Zia believes having a native son govern the NWFP will go a long way in reducing tensions. The NWFP is of vital interest to Pakistan, Afghanistan is often trying to stir tribal unrest and Pathan nationalists within the province have long advocated for either independence, greater autonomy, or unification with Afghanistan. General Fazle is expected to handle these external and internal challenges while strengthening the patriotic citizens of the province. The general is expected to retire from the Army to devote his efforts to administrating the province and be seen not as a military strongman."
 Zia_Era.9.d:0 "The growing number of Afghan refugees are causing immense strains on local resources and is raising tensions. So far, many refugees are able to stay with family on our side of the border, however, we estimate the refugee population to continue growing. Many senior military and civilian leaders believe Pakistan has the moral responsibility to aid Muslims suffering hardship and believe we must immediately take efforts to provide funds, supplies, and grounds for refugee camps. Other advisors believe the costs are too high and argue we should let the situation continue as it appears the local population so far has been able to accommodate the Afghans."
 Zia_Era.10.d:0 "The United Nations, with support from western states and our friends in the region, have agreed to establish a refugee agency to handle the Afghan refugees. The UN will soon begin to funnel funds and supplies for refugees, greatly reducing the burden on us. The UN reports have highlighted the strong efforts we have made so far, and our international image is at an all-time high. The Afghan refugees are also expressing their appreciation both to UN officials and foreign media covering the story. This is a major relief for our government."
 Zia_Era.11.d:0 "Makeshift refugee camps have been established as the number of refugees flooding into the NWFP is far more than the local population can bear. In some of our areas, Afghan refugees are constructing makeshift homes and chopping down all the local trees for firewood. The ecological and economic costs on local communities is mounting. With fears that desperate refugees may turn to violence or our own people may turn on the refugees, the federal government has decided to step in. They are ordering us to provide extensive resources and accommodate the refugees, no matter the cost. It appears our initial efforts at trying to let the refugee crisis resolve itself has failed."
 Zia_Era.12.d:0 "General Zia ul-Haq has put his closest ally in the Army, Lt. General Rahimuddin Khan to take over as Governor and Martial Law Administrator of Baluchistan. A skilled administrator, General Rahimuddin is expected to take a hands-on roll in dealing with internal dissent and directing development in the historically restive province. Where his predecessors largely engaged in military operations against Baluch separatists, the new Governor is expected to try and peacefully end the operations and bring a new program of development for the people of Baluchistan."
 Zia_Era.13.d:0 "The Martial Law Administration Baluchistan announced plans to offer a general amnesty to all remaining Baluch separatist fighters. In addition, Pakistan military personnel are to immediately return to their peacetime garrisons and the number of troops in the province will be reduced. These efforts are already paying dividends as many Baluch rebels have already accepted the amnesty. With the troops leaving, the rebel tribal elders are struggling to explain why the fighting must continue. Especially after the government announced plans for new development projects meant to lift the people in the province. It appears the new military government has learned from the bloody lessons of the 1970s."

 Delhi_Ageement.1.d:0 "Following the Simla Agreement, the Foreign Ministers of Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh met in New Delhi. The three sides signed an agreement called the Delhi Agreement. This agreement the United Nations will oversee the repatriation of thousands of Bengali military personnel, government officials, and their families currently interned in Pakistan. The thousands of Pakistani POWs, government officials and their families being held in India and Bangladesh will also be exchanged. The Bangladeshis were resistant to the agreement as it included nearly two hundred Pakistani officers it accuses of war crimes. However, the Indian government pressed their compliance. The people of Pakistan eagerly await the return of its soldiers."

 PAK_Kashmir_70s.1.d:0 "The senior officers at GHQ are debating whether we should begin calling up reserves in anticipation for the situation in Kashmir escalating or not. It would give us greater tactical flexibility and allow our frontline opportunities immediate access to reinforcements. However, such a move, even if hidden as routine exercises will likely be noticed by the Indians, and they may decide to call up their own reserves. If the Indians do not notice, the element of surprises will be thoroughly in our control. The Corps Commanders will have to reach some resolution on the matter."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.2.d:0 "Intelligence reports indicate the Pakistanis are calling up a number of reserve personnel. This is not unprecedented, it follows previous trends where we observed similar mobilization orders before largescale military exercises. Many of the senior defense leaders believe our forces can vigilantly monitor Pakistani movements and calling up our own reserves is unnecessary and put a burden on the economy. The Army commanders concur they are prepared, but believe a mobilization would provide greater tactical flexibility. The Prime Minister must make the final decision."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.3.d:0 "The senior leadership of the Pakistan government and military met for secret talks at the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi. The Corps Commander in Kashmir stated the military was prepared, motivated, and eager to carry out a limited campaign against Indian forces. A successful, rapid strike could dislodge the occupying Indian power, after which we will call for the implementation of the UN resolutions. Simply seizing the territory or claiming it would only provoke an all-out Indian attack. Some of the government leaders and an Air Force commander questioned whether the objectives could be achieved so rapidly and whether it is realistic to expect India not to escalate the conflict. The two sides started to debate on what to do until a decision was made..."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.4.d:0 "The Indian government and UN observers report that Pakistani forces have crossed the border across Kashmir and are advancing on Indian positions. The Pakistan government claimed its action was in response to a major Indian ceasefire violation. Pakistan insists this round of fighting will only end when India agrees to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir and that Pakistan was only giving a befitting reply to Indian aggression. The Indian Prime Minister is chairing a meeting with senior military and defense leaders. Both the United States and Soviet Union released statements urging an immediate end to hostilities."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.5.d:0 "The Prime Minister is chairing a meeting with senior military and defense leaders at the Ministry of Defence. He received initial reports of the Pakistan attacks in Kashmir. The Army leadership believes the Pakistani operations are localized and they hope to keep the fighting confined to Kashmir. The Defence Minister asked about the possibility of expanding the conflict into a general war. The Indian military leadership stated a general war would likely incur a quick international reaction and likely a return to prewar borders, unless a rapid breakthrough is achieved. They concluded that if the Prime Minister believes the Army capable of defending Kashmir, an escalation is not necessary, and more territory can be taken in the Kashmir counterattack. But if the Pakistanis appear to have the upper hand, expanding the conflict will stretch their forces and weaken their offensive capabilities."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.6.d:0 "The United Nations Secretary General announced a ceasefire would come into effect between India and Pakistan. The two sides are expected to dig in their current positions until the final situation is assessed. The conflict began after Pakistan launched an attack across the disputed Kashmir border. The Indian government responded by escalating the conflict by striking across the international border. Indians and Pakistanis will both be happy to see an end to the conflict."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.7.d:0 "Following the UN ceasefire, it is clear our forces have succeeded in seizing key territory in Kashmir and retaining control of our major cities. The Indian military utterly failed in its gambit to escalate the conflict to relieve pressure in Kashmir or take key territory to either seize land or bargain a return to pre-war borders. We are now faced with a decision. We can now push for the implementation of UN resolutions on Kashmir, leaving the choice to the people of Kashmir or we can instead keep our territorial gains in Kashmir. The first option puts the Kashmir dispute to a vote, which we do not control but retaining the territories could lead to a future conflict with India."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.8.d:0 "The people of Pakistan are in a euphoric mood following news that Pakistan was holding on to its major gains in Kashmir. Throngs of people took to the streets of Karachi and Lahore to celebrate, building a festive atmosphere. Kashmiri refugees in Rawalpindi stood outside the GHQ to thank the military for its sacrifices and services in liberating Kashmiri people. The government will bask in the glory of its victory and there are already reports of Azad Kashmiri officials moving into the new territory."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.9.d:0 "The situation across India is somber but tense. Many Indians are shocked at the military reversals their forces suffered and the retreat from key Kashmiri lands. There are reports of sporadic, angry demonstrations calling for generals and ministers to either be sacked or tried for their failures. The Indian government has pledged to look after refugees and Kashmiri officials displaced by the Pakistan Army. The Indian military is expected to undergo a lot of soul searching in order to understand what went wrong in its battleplans."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.10.d:0 "The Pakistani invasion was not just thrown back, but our forces have exacted a punishing defeat to its armed forces. Indian troops now control key areas of Pakistani occupied Kashmir and Pakistan itself. The Indian public is said to be jubilant, with reports of Indian soldiers across the nation receiving sweets and flowers from the general public. The Pakistani defeat will make them think twice about future misadventures. The Prime Minister also received a message from parliament congratulating the government and military for its swift action to defend the republic."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.11.d:0 "The recent Indo-Pakistan conflict ended inconclusively. By the time fighting ended, neither side had a decisive advantage over the other. Both sides possess enough territory to bargain for a return to pre-war borders. Although the Indian government hoped to deliver a punishing reply, it will be satisfied that the status quo remains. For Pakistan, although it avoided a military defeat, it did not achieve a victory and will have to deal with the consequences of it failed Kashmir adventure."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.12.d:0 "The operation to defreeze Kashmir and force the implementation of UN resolutions has ended in failure. The Pakistan Army fought bravely, against overwhelming odds, but could not achieve its objectives. The people of Pakistan are despondent with the result and many are questioning why such an operation was launched if victory could not be achieved. The Pakistan military and government will have a lot of questions to answer for, despite its efforts to portray the result as a successful defense against an Indian invasion."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.13.d:0 "The treacherous Pakistani attack in Kashmir failed to stir an uprising or defeat our forces. The Indian Army retains control of its territory. The Indian government released a statement congratulating its military for its steadfast defence of Kashmir and her people. The Indian ambassador to the United Nations stated the Pakistanis have suffered such a reversal that they will think twice before considering such a misadventure again. Time will tell if this will hold true."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.14.d:0 "The Pakistan General Headquarters in Rawalpindi was abuzz with excitement following reports that its offensive in Kashmir succeeded in dislodging Indian forces and gaining new territories for Pakistan. With our demonstration of military strength in the region, we can now approach the Indians to finally implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir. However, several Corps Commanders believe the better approach is to hold on to our gains for a future operation to liberate all of Kashmir. They argue to bring in the UN now would surrender the military advantage and we should establish a new line of control."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.15.d:0 "It is undeniable that Indian forces have been pushed back in key areas along the border of Kashmir. This military setback is a major embarrassment for the Indian government and puts its forces in Kashmir at a strategic disadvantage. The Parliament is criticizing the government for its failure during the conflict and is calling for an explanation from the military. The Indian military has already started an investigation to study what went wrong in the recent fighting."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.16.d:0 "The Pakistani government has asked us to begin the process of implementing the UN resolutions on Kashmir. They insist the Kashmir situation must be decided by its people and not through armed conflict. This is a hypocritical stance, but their recent territorial gains do give their forces a better position in the disputed territory. Some senior officials believe it might be worth pursuing as it would end the conflict and not leave our forces vulnerable to future operations. Other officials and senior military leaders oppose the proposal, saying India cannot give in to the demands as it is clear blackmail. They argue in time, India will be able to retake the lost territory."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.17.d:0 "The wild Pakistan adventure to seize Kashmir has been thwarted. In the course of the fighting, Pakistani forces were not only halted, but driven back in key areas. Our troops now sit at a strategic advantage in Kashmir. We are now left with two choices, we could restore the prewar borders and declare a victory. This would be well-received internationally and show we are not the power bent on using armed force to gain lands from our neighbors. Or we can hold on to our new territory as punishment for the Pakistani action. Holding on to the territory would raise the risk for a future conflict as the Pakistanis will be enraged and even more desperate in time."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.18.d:0 "The treacherous Pakistani attack in Kashmir failed to stir an uprising or defeat our forces. The Indian Army retains control of its territory. The Indian government released a statement congratulating its military for its steadfast defence of Kashmir and her people. The Indian ambassador to the United Nations stated the Pakistanis have suffered such a reversal that they will think twice before considering such a misadventure again. Time will tell if this will hold true."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.19.d:0 "The treacherous Pakistani attack in Kashmir failed to stir an uprising or defeat our forces. The Indian Army retains control of its territory and seize some Pakistani territory in the counterattack. The Indian government released a statement congratulating its military for its steadfast defence of Kashmir and her people. The Indian ambassador to the United Nations stated the Pakistanis have suffered such a reversal that they will think twice before considering such a misadventure again. Time will tell if this will hold true."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.20.d:0 "Despite careful planning and an aggressive attack, our operation to defreeze Kashmir and force India into accepting a ceasefire has failed. The Indians remain in control of their positions and our forces were beaten back. This was not the fault of the Pakistan soldier who carried out his duty with elan and discipline, but a result of failed leadership and imagination from the commanders. The people of Pakistan are expected to react angrily at this setback and for the millions of Kashmiris displaced by Indian violence, they will remain greatly disappointed."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.21.d:0 "Our embassy in London reported the establishment of a new Kashmir Nationalist Party by Kashmiri students studying abroad. The organization consists of Indian Kashmiris along with Pakistani Kashmiris. The new group plans to stage protests and publicize the Kashmir dispute in order to garner international awareness of the situation. Its members are pressing for either independence or the implementation of UN resolutions in the territory. We believe the Pakistan government is playing a major role in supporting the organization in order to outflank us internationally."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.22.d:0 "The Pakistan delegation at the United Nations made an impassioned call for the implementation of UN resolutions on Kashmir. They noted that hundreds of Kashmiris abroad have approached their missions begging for a resolution and reunion of their families separated by the decades long dispute. This is the conclusion of a wider Pakistani diplomatic offensive to raise awareness on Kashmir and put international pressure on us to agree. Some in the government believe it may be time to accept and implement the resolution. It would end the conflict and allow us to focus more on our economy and demonstrate to the Kashmiri people our commitment to them. However, most of the cabinet believes what diplomatic goodwill we lose by refusing does not match sacrificing our position in Kashmir and strategic advantage over Pakistan."
 PAK_Kashmir_70s.23.d:0 "Our efforts to bring in diplomatic pressure on India at the United Nations failed. The Indians remain steadfast in their occupation of Kashmir, despite the diplomatic costs. This is a major setback for the Pakistan government which banked heavily on a diplomatic approach to resolving the conflict. The Pakistan military will view this development quite negatively. The fear among the Foreign Ministry is that the future resolution of Kashmir will now be determined on the battlefield instead of the diplomatic table."

 Elahi.1.d:0 "The Pakistani Ambassador delivered a message from President Elahi. He requests the Kingdom meet with him and his senior defense officers to hold talks on cementing a strategic relationship between our nations. The Pakistani President noted the historical bond linking us and the devotion our peoples feel for one another. In the past the Pakistanis have provided us with experts and military training. Many in our government are open to meeting with this high-level delegation to determine what sort of agreement could be reached. A few officials however, suggest we deny the request and not entangle ourselves with any state, no matter the relationship."
 Elahi.2.d:0 "The Pakistani President and his top military and economic advisors held talks with the Saudi King and his senior ministers. During the talks, the Pakistanis proposed a comprehensive agreement. In exchange for military experts and a permanent military presence to protect the Kingdom, we would offer Pakistan economic subsidies. This is a major agreement, our advisors believe if we are not comfortable with the agreement, we could politely call for further consultations and end the meeting as a warming of ties between our nations."
 Elahi.3.d:0 "The Saudi government accepted our proposal and we signed the Strategic Agreement in Riyadh. The news is being very well-received among the Pakistani people. The religious parties in our coalition are especially thrilled with the agreement. The Pakistan military is already dispatching advisors and developing plans with their Saudi counterparts on potential troop deployments if needed. The Saudis have expressed an immense satisfaction to the agreement and the continued deepening of our relationship. A new era for Pakistan-Saudi relations has begun."
 Elahi.4.d:0 "The Pakistani government is very excited over the recent agreement. Our own military is excited over the prospects of experienced Pakistani military personnel arriving to improve the defense capabilities of our forces. The Ministry of Information will soon spread word of the agreement to the local media and international press. We are expecting a positive response. The Pakistani agreement to defend the Kingdom from foreign aggression is also welcome news and will allow our leaders more leeway domestically. The agreement marks a new era in Saudi-Pakistani relations."
 Elahi.5.d:0 "The recent shift towards a more Islamic identity, to better push our nation to the national ideology as laid by our founders has resulted in backlash from Bengalis in East Pakistan. Their provincial assembly, dominated by leftists has openly condemned the recent policies and call for Bengali independence. The President is going to Dacca in order to quell the tensions. Bengalis are a much more religiously diverse population and have followed the dangerous, secular ideology of the Awami League for decades. We will have to consider if a mutual separation would be for the best. However, a United Pakistan remains a strong Pakistan."
 
 PAK_AL75.1.d:0 "President Mujibur Rahman of Pakistan recently sent a message calling for Foreign Minister level talks in Karachi. The Pakistanis wish to build trust with us and increase trade relations. Our senior advisors do not believe the Pakistanis wish a total engagement with us, however, even an incremental improvement in ties could lead to eventual normalization. There are some officials who believe we should reject this initiative, they think a hardline should be maintained until Pakistan fully commits to establishing neighborly relations. A decision must be made."
 PAK_AL75.2.d:0 "The Foreign Ministers of Pakistan and India met in Karachi for talks. The meeting took place following a Pakistani invitation to India. The two sides signed an agreement promoting trade and increasing the number of diplomats in both states. Both governments released statements praising the agreement as a positive step in the right direction. Despite the agreement, both sides acknowledged there remained many outstanding issues that will need to be addressed in the future. Internationally, the talks are being praised. Upon reaching the Provincial Assembly building, the President addressed the media. He stated his understanding that some East Pakistanis feel disenchanted with the current electoral system and he looks forward to the upcoming talks."
 
 PAK_1975_Election.1.d:0 "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto announced the Pakistan Peoples Party had left its coalition with the Awami League. He cited an increasing divergence in ideological goals and concern over Bengali domination of the coalition. Bhutto stated the PPP planned to lead a coalition of left and center-left parties to provide Pakistanis true Islamic socialism. An Awami League spokesman confirmed the split, blaming Bhutto for unreasonable demands on the coalition. Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman did not comment, but has been rumored to be increasingly annoyed with the ambitious PPP leader."
 PAK_1975_Election.2.d:0 "Following an especially bitter election campaign, Pakistani voters are going to the polls. The three choices are coalitions led by Mujibur Rahman, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi. The young, charismatic Bhutto leads a powerful center-left coalition. Taking some of the more moderate elements of the left from political stalwart Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Finally, Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi, a respected industrialist, commands a coalition of conservative parties focused on reducing socialism in the country and champion the Islamic principles Pakistan was founded on. The people must now decide."
 
 Awami_League_Unrest.1.d:0 "The Awami League, which dominates the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly recently passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Bengal nation. This radical resolution has caused an uproar in West Pakistan and the National Assembly. The President also reacted strongly and has flown to Dacca for talks with the Awami League. As the talks began, it became clear to the President by the reception he received from the people and the Awami League that there is little faith in united Pakistan. Many in the province feel the country is drifting away from them and that the last election showed a bias is growing that prevents the growth of Bengali national leaders. The President must decide if he will seek a compromise on East Pakistan independence, or take a hardline and insist on a United Pakistan. Considering how closely integrated the two wings are militarily, there appears little chance of the situation escalating into an armed conflict as that would be catastrophic for both sides."
 Awami_League_Unrest.2.d:0 "News of the Pakistani refusal to compromise has sparked massive riots in the federal areas of Dacca. Government buildings and courts were torched by angry protestors, in many instances the police simply stood by and did not intervene to halt the violence. This show of popular outrage has brought many advisors to suggest the President change course and accept Bangladesh, however, there are some who continue to urge him to pursue a United Pakistan. The situation is very tense."
 Awami_League_Unrest.3.d:0 "With talks stalling and tensions mounting both in West and East Pakistan, the Awami League called for Bangladesh Day across the province. In homes across East Pakistan, Bengalis placed homemade flags for Bangladesh to indicate their support for the Awami League efforts. This action has shaken even West Pakistanis. Many are now of the opinion if the Bengalis wish to leave so badly, the government should just let them go. The President has concurred and will inform the Awami League representatives the next time they meet."
 Awami_League_Unrest.4.d:0 "President of Pakistan and Awami League leadership signed a public document calling for the independence of Bangladesh. The people of Dacca went into full celebration mode following the signing with music and celebration throughout the night. Over the next three months, West Pakistanis will be repatriated back to Pakistan as power is handed over. As part of the agreement, Pakistan will not be obligated to "pay" Bangladesh back for any development funds used from its revenue since independence. People in West Pakistan are taking the news in stride, many hoping this will finally end the never-ending tensions between the two wings of the country."
 Awami_League_Unrest.5.d:0 "Bangladesh officially joined the community of nations as the Pakistan government officially granted sovereignty to the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly. Although the Pakistani government has claimed to be comfortable with the change, many Bangladeshis noted the haste in which they evacuated their personnel and supplies from the province. More significantly, the Pakistan state sent only its foreign minister for the flag raising ceremony. Regardless, the Awami League praised the peaceful transition and hoped for continued good relations between the two brotherly nations."
 Awami_League_Unrest.6.d:0 "The Awami League, which controls the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly recently passed a resolution calling for the establishment of a Bengal nation. This radical resolution has caused an uproar in West Pakistan and the National Assembly. The President also reacted strongly and has flown to Dacca for talks with the Awami League. Upon his arrival, many residents filled the streets, cheering the presidential motorcade. The recent electoral success of the President in East Pakistan and the public support shows many in East Pakistan remain firmly committed to the state."
 Awami_League_Unrest.7.d:0 "After several days of talks, the Awami League agreed to withdraw its resolution calling for a Bengali nation. The Awami League quickly found its position of strength eroded as supporters of the government soon dominated the streets of Dacca, rallying to the President. To save face, the Pakistan government promised to support more local cultural initiatives and consider reforming how many seats East Pakistan is entitled to at the National Assembly. However, many analysts believe this last point will not result in any change. Across Pakistan, the President is enjoying widespread support, as newspaper editorials claim the recent events prove the constitution is now the supreme law for all Pakistanis. The Awami League released its own statement, claiming it had achieved great results for securing the rights of East Pakistanis. Provincialism appears to be on a path of steady decline."

However, we lack a large, working class population or a university system capable of meeting the labor, education, medical, or engineering demands needed to grow with our wealth. In recent months we have offered guest worker visas for thousands of Pakistanis to come work in the country. The overwhelming majority of these workers are male, and a large portion will work in construction or service industry positions. However, we are also bringing in doctors, engineers, and other professionals to help run new hospitals and oversee new development projects."

 PAK_Afghan_War.10.d:0 "The unprecedented Afghan refugee presence is overwhelming local authorities and causing conflict in our border cities. GHQ has tasked the local corps commander to take control of the situation. Army engineers plan on establishing refugee camps outside Peshawar and other towns. The Army will work closely with civil servants to establish effective communication between the refugees and our government. The refugees are being led by their traditional tribal elders, as such, we plan on distributing aid directly to these elders and let them distribute it to families. The Army Medical Corps, working with foreign aid organizations plan on establishing field hospitals as well. This will help lessen the social tensions caused by the refugees and show our brotherly commitment to aiding the Afghan people."
 PAK_Afghan_War.11.d:0 "After intense analysis, the ISI has identified the major rebel groups willing and capable of launching operations against the Soviet backed puppet regime. Military aid to the rebels from outside sources will be strictly controlled by the ISI, who will distribute the arms to the most effective groups. Those groups which lack the will to engage in armed struggle will not receive arms or cash. Brigadier Mohamad Yousaf, the recently appointed head of the Afghan Bureau, is the point man for this arms pipeline. Arms imported to Karachi are to be transported with civilian vehicles to Mujahideen camps being established near the border."

 Bhutto_70s.1.d:0 "The Organization of Islamic Countries has selected Pakistan to hold its next Islamic Summit in Lahore. The meeting will see the heads of states of Muslim nations across the globe assemble for three days. The OIC noted Pakistan is an exceptional member of the organization and deserving of this privilege. The Pakistani government released its own statement expressing the deep honor it feels for this honor. It noted Lahore has long been a center of Islam in South Asia. Newspapers across Pakistan have published reports indicating the pride the people of Pakistan are feeling and their excitement to playing host to their Islamic brothers."
 Bhutto_70s.2.d:0 "Zulfikar Bhutto has spent the last couple weeks flying across the Muslim world to hand personal invitations to heads of states. The reports are being closely followed by the local press and many Pakistanis are growing increasingly excited by the upcoming summit. Many nations have already promised to attend with several leaders sending personal messages to the people of Pakistan expressing the honor they felt to be personally invited. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is also personally overseeing the preparations in Lahore. Many local businesses and organizations have already promised to offer services and performances for the conference."
 Bhutto_70s.3.d:0 "Zulfikar Ali Bhutto opened the second Islamic Summit of the Organization of Islamic Countries. Over forty Muslim heads of states are in attendance along with senior officials from several other states. The Pakistani leader emphasized the need for Islamic unity during these difficult times and invited all the participants to explore Lahore. In his remarks, Bhutto promised the continued support of the Islamic world for the people of Palestine and the Arab states. To thunderous applause, Bhutto unveiled the Islamic Solidarity Fund which will enhance Islamic culture, unity, and education. The Pakistani media and wider Muslim press wrote glowing reviews of the opening of the conference. During the first state dinner, Bhutto was invited to sit with the King of Saudi Arabia."
 Bhutto_70s.4.d:0 "Charismatic Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi addressed a full stadium of Pakistanis at Lahore Stadium. In his thundering speech, Gaddafi thanked the people of Lahore and proclaimed the eternal brotherhood between Pakistan and Libya. The crowd especially cheered when Gaddafi proclaimed what belonged to the Libyan people was also for the people of Pakistan. He received the loudest cheers when he spoke of the unlimited potential of Pakistan. The speech was widely reported across Pakistan and many are calling for the Pakistan Cricket Board to change the name of the stadium to Gaddafi Stadium, which appears likely. Following his address, Gaddafi met with Zulfikar Bhutto and the two leaders signed agreements guaranteeing the arrival of Pakistani guest workers and military advisors along with Libyan oil subsidies."
 Bhutto_70s.5.d:0 "During one of the major addresses at the OIC, the Pakistan Foreign Minister made a powerful state condemning the continued occupation of Muslim lands by Israel and India. The speech was well-received by Muslim leaders in attendance. The Indian press is said to be fuming. Although an observer member of the OIC, India refused to send any representative and now the Indian government is being blamed for not being there to oppose the anti-Indian agenda. Zulfikar Bhutto is being praised in Pakistan for successfully demonstrating international support for the Pakistan cause."
 Bhutto_70s.6.d:0 "In appreciation to all Pakistan has provided and done during the OIC conference, the Gulf states have pledged to provide financial support to the Pakistan government. Zulfikar Bhutto signed the series of agreements and expressed hope Pakistan and the Gulf states will forge a long-lasting bond with one another. The agreements are being widely praised as providing Pakistan a major economic boost in a difficult economic environment. Pakistan also signed agreements committing the military to provide training missions for major Gulf nations in order to improve their defence capabilities. The King of Saudi Arabia released his own statement expressing his deep admiration to the people of Pakistan and the graciousness he has received in Lahore."
 Bhutto_70s.7.d:0 "The Second Islamic Conference of the Organization of Islamic Countries officially concluded. Pakistani leader Zulfikar Bhutto personally saw off many of the attendees at Allama Iqbal Airport. The conference has been a massive success for Pakistan in demonstrating its position in the Islamic world. More importantly, the conference yielded many positive results for Pakistan. Bhutto has greatly legitimized his status among the people of Pakistan and as an international leader. The people of Lahore will not soon forget the memories of the conference."
 Bhutto_70s.8.d:0 "Pakistan has dispatched a high-level delegation to visit Kabul. They are offering an opportunity for us to normalize relations and end the recent tensions between our states. Normalizing ties may protect us if the situation escalates in the future. However, to do so would risk alienating our domestic population. Many in the country have family across the border and passionately believe Pakistan continues to occupy sacred Afghan soil. We must decide how to handle the delegation. We can engage them or rebuff them by sending low level officials to talk with them."
 Bhutto_70s.9.d:0 "Over a decade ago Afghanistan actively sought to raise unrest and provoke armed rebellion within Pakistan. There efforts naturally failed to challenge the sovereignty and national unity of the Pakistani people. However, Afghanistan has not forgotten and in the future may try again. Zulfikar Bhutto recently received a proposal to reach out to the Tajiks and Islamists in Afghanistan. These two groups are against conflict with our state and are interested in strengthening their position within Afghanistan. If we reach out to them and establish contacts, these can be very effective in the future and demonstrate to Afghanistan that we can hurt them just as badly. However, there are others in the defence establishment who believe we should leave it be and not involve ourselves in Afghanistan."
 Bhutto_70s.10.d:0 "General Naseerullah Babar, Director General of Military Intelligence briefed Pakistani leader Zulfikar Bhutto on a proposed plan to extradite key anti-Kabul religious and Tajik leaders to Pakistan. These men would undergo training, establish connections with Pakistan, and provide briefings on what is happening in Afghanistan. The risk of discovery by Afghanistan is minimum and if they do, they will not likely speak out. Considering how many of our dissidents they hose publicly in Kabul. Among those to be extradited are Ahmad Shah Masood, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and Gulbadin Hekmatyr. The Tajik activists represent a community which resents the Pashtunistan agenda and its impact on both Afghan society and economy. The religious leaders are mostly Pashtoons who also oppose the Afghan government for its perceived anti-Islamic policies. They also want warm relations with Pakistan who they see as a fellow Islamic state."
 Bhutto_70s.11.d:0 "After several months of discussions and training courses, our intelligence agencies successfully returned the religious and Tajik leaders to Afghanistan. We now have a much clearer sense of Afghanistan, its fragile politics, and the struggle for the state to extend its influence beyond urban centers. General Naseerullah Babar recently presented a briefing that advocated the establishment of clandestine routes across the border to provide arms to these rebel factions. He pointed out that the Afghan government is actively targeting such groups and daily improving their methods of cracking down. Babur recommended we approve the transfer of weapons to preserve these opposition groups and cement our ties to them. Some advisors believe the Afghan rebels would just use the weapons for operations and Pakistan should not risk a new conflict with Afgahnistan."
 Bhutto_70s.12.d:0 "Our opposition contacts in Afghanistan report the Afghan government continues a policy meant to undermine Islam in the country and remove Tajiks as a political force within the country. They now request permission from us to use the weapons we have already provided for armed attacks against the Afghan government. They also asked for additional arms to support their offensive. Our intelligence leaders inform us even if we deny them authorization, the Afghan opposition feels threatened and will act regardless. Our military advisors advocate we give authorization and dispatch more arms and supplies across the border to complete our mission of punishing the Afghan government. Other advisors fear such attacks could embarrass us if rebels leak information of our involvement."
 Bhutto_70s.13.d:0 "The media is reporting extensively of major attacks targeting government officials and security forces in small towns and villages, mostly in Tajik areas of the country. The hit and run operations show some sophistication and early reports indicate these attacks are being launched by angry Tajiks and disgruntled Pushtoon religiously inspired fighters. In some instances our troops were reported to have fled against forces they greatly outnumbered, our commanders indicate these are isolated incidents involving poorly led conscripts. The rebels are too small in numbers to seize territories but the confidence of the people is shaken and our military feels humiliated. Many in Kabul suspect Pakistan is involved in the training and arming o these groups."
 Bhutto_70s.14.d:0 "Our government and military recently concluded a press conference in which we declared victory over a recent attempt by foreign backed rebel fighters to seize the country. Although initial attacks appeared strong, the rebels quickly lost steam and we were able to move our best troops to the right areas to blunt further attacks. The media and people of Kabul are full of praise for the government and military might of Afghanistan. Already we are informing the world media and presenting testimony from captured rebels that they were armed and directed by Pakistan. Afghanistan will triumph and the nefarious plot of our neighbor has been snuffed out."
 Bhutto_70s.15.d:0 "The Pakistan Army Chief recently received a special Defence Paper from Zulfikar Bhutto himself. The report, written in consultation with his security advisors, including some officers involved in the infamous Rawalpindi Conspiracy, calls for radical changes in the Pakistan Army. In the document Bhutto advocates for the Army to transform into a Peoples Army that can better mobilize the working class and peasants in order to counter the demographic advantage of India. At first glance, most of the senior officers believe the document is ridiculous and threatens not just institutional integrity but the stability of Pakistan. No one wants to arm the peasants. However, pro-Bhutto officers support it and are pressing the Army Chief to embrace it. It is ultimately up to the Army Chief to decide."
 Bhutto_70s.16.d:0 "Pakistani leader Zulfikar Ali Bhutto long advocated for closer civil-military cooperation and has recently began sitting at Promotion Boards to observe and provide input. This marks a major transformation for the Pakistan Army as for years it maintained a strict separation of its institutional practices from civil involvement. Many senior Pakistani officers are watching the development with nervous apprehension as it appears the Army will be promoting officers not just on their capabilities as officers but also on their perceived loyalty to the PPP and Bhutto himself. A group of retired generals published a open letter condemning the politicization of the military, however, the Army remains committed to implementing the reforms proposed by Bhutto months ago."
 Bhutto_70s.17.d:0 "The Pakistan military informed a stunned Zulfikar Bhutto that they had uncovered a plot by junior Army and Air Force officers to overthrow the government. Pakistani intelligence agencies were tipped off to the plot after one of the conspirators confided to his superior officer. It appears there are a number of officers in the military who view Bhutto with apprehension and fear for the future of not just the military but Pakistan itself. Bhutto soon addressed the nation, condemning Bonapartism and pledging to uproot anti-state conspirators from the top to bottom. The Pakistan military informed Bhutto they were setting up a military tribunal to root out other plotters. The Army Chief has an officer in mind to run the tribunal, however, some close advisors to Bhutto suggest he insist Brigadier Zia ul-Haq, a promising, apolitical but zealous officer lead the tribunal."
 Bhutto_70s.18.d:0 "The appointment of Brigadier Zia ul-Haq to head the military tribunal investigating an anti-Bhutto coup plot has successfully uncovered several cells of conspirators in cantonments across Pakistan. Even those just suspected of involvement are being ruthlessly questioned by the tribunal and almost all are either resigning from the military or if evidence is uncovered, sentenced to harsh prison terms. Zulfikar Bhutto is said to be very pleased with the tribunal and expressed his desire to the Army Chief that Zia advance further in his career. Some retired officers advising Bhutto however, urged him to be cautious as they note Zia is driven not purely out of a desire to protect the government, but also to restore the chain of command within the military."
 Bhutto_70s.19.d:0 "The military tribunal investigating the alleged anti-Bhutto coup plot has successfully identified cells operating primarily in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. The Tribunal noted that many of the alleged plotters had not even plotted beyond an agreement that Bhutto was bad for the country and military. As a result, many of the accused were given official reprimands and negative marks in their records but are allowed to stay in the military. Those found to be more deeply involved, especially the Air Force and Army officers in Karachi, are being dismissed from the services and the leaders being given prison sentences. The tribunal noted the importance of restoring the chain of command across all units and condemned the plots as undermining the institution. Zulfikar Bhutto is following the tribunal closely and is satisfied by their actions, though personally he feels annoyed at the emphasis on chain of command over the crime of treason in plotting to overthrow his government."
 Bhutto_70s.20.d:0 "The question of what to do about the Ahmadiyya sect in Pakistan continues to plague the government. The sect, whose followers are called Ahmadis, are mostly based in Lahore where they play a prominent role in business and industry. They identify themselves as Muslims, however, many of the other Muslim sects in Pakistan, including the major religious political organizations, condemn the group for denying that Prophet Muhammad was the last prophet and for deifying its founder, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. These tensions resulted in the violent Lahore Riots of 1953 in which the Army deployed to end the violence and protect the Ahmadis. At the time the government refused to accept the rioters demands that Ahmadis be called non-Muslim. However, tensions are rising again with many Pakistanis condemning Ahmadis for allegedly using their wealth to convert poor villagers in villages around Lahore. Zulfikar Bhutto will soon bring an amendment for the National Assembly on declaring Ahmadis non-Muslim in order to garner support for his party and end criticism from religious groups that he is involved in anti-Islamic policies."

 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.1.d:0 "The leaders of religious parties have organized with leading spiritual leaders to launch a series of major protests across cities in Pakistan. They are blocking main roads and condemning what they see as the continued moral degradation of the nation. It appears the recent electoral failure of the religious parties has raised fears among many Muslim communities that the country is moving away from its Islamic roots. The protestors want the government to legislatively ensure the Islamic character of the nation. Many Pakistani business owners announced they will shutter their shops periodically in support of the protests. A statement released by the leading Islamic community leaders in the country announced there will be regular protests and economic boycotts across the country until their concerns are addressed."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.2.d:0 "The current protests and boycotts are becoming insufferable for the government. A high-level meeting is being held with the relevant security heads and cabinet members. Some want to deploy police and other security agencies to crack down on the protests, they may not be able to end the unrest but they can certainly lessen the impact. Such an action does come with risks as it may simply embolden the protestors. The other option is to open talks with the religious committees. We can probably make enough promises for local changes, but again, negotiations also come with risks, as these groups could feel emboldened to expand their claims."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.3.d:0 "The recent police crackdown on the large-scale religious protests being spearheaded by the Islamic political parties have resulted in a noticeable reduction in disorder. The decision to not arrest religious leaders but instead target their main supporters proved apt. While the prayer leaders continue to make speeches, the lack of ringleaders on the ground to direct unrest has greatly weakened the impact of the protests. In addition, the successful prosecutions have acted as an effective deterrent to prevent new leaders from emerging. The government will be satisfied with its success."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.4.d:0 "The recent police crackdown on the large-scale religious protests being spearheaded by the Islamic political parties has failed to weaken the unrest. Although the government focused on arresting facilitators instead of religious leaders to avoid enflaming the protestors, the charges are not sticking in the courts. More importantly, some of these local organizers are becoming more prominent as they propagate their agenda at court hearings and to the media. The protestors are redoubling their efforts and inspiring more people to join in the campaign for the National Assembly to legislate an Islamic identity for the country."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.5.d:0 "After intense negotiations, the government and religious protest leaders agreed on a series of compromises. The government has promised to refrain from prosecuting protestors accused of disorderly conduct, while the protestors will reduce the economic protests. Both sides gave statements to the media stating the agreement will cool tensions and enable a more positive environment as the National Assembly considers the issue."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.6.d:0 "The government confirmed efforts at negotiating with the religious protest leaders has ended in failure. It appears the protest leaders saw the negotiations as a sign of weakness and have only expanded their demands to include shutting down markets on Friday until the afternoon. The economic impact of this would be dramatic, making negotiations impossible. The media has eviscerated the government, blaming it for a lack of strategy to deal with the increasing protests.."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.7.d:0 "The opposition has brought forward the demands of the Islamic parties and religious protest leaders calling for the constitution to more completely reflect the Islamic character of Pakistan. The nationwide protests will not subside unless these demands are explored. The government can take two approaches, one is to cautiously oppose these proposals. They can do so by arguing the nation already enjoys an Islamic identity. We can work to convince the opposition to join the government in opposing the more radical demands and restore order. The other approach is to embrace the proposals and work with the opposition to resolve their demands in a way that does not compromise the constitution."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.8.d:0 "In a thundering address, the Prime Minister condemned the opposition for using the concern people have with Islam as a political tool to target the leading institutions of the nation. He stated what the protests show exactly why Islam should not be muddied by the affairs of state."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.9.d:0 "In an extraordinary National Assembly debate, the government parliamentarians quizzed opposition and Islamic party leaders on what is a Muslim. The answers varied quite a bit, depending on the background and sect practiced by the individual responding. After the discussion, the Prime Minister noted that Islam has a diverse presence across Pakistan and as a result any effort to legislate this identity is doomed to failure. He asked the assembly that if there could be no agreement on who a Muslim is how can the National Assembly even consider the question of passing legislation related to Islam."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.10.d:0 "The opposition appears divided following the last debate with the government at the National Assembly. Several members have decided to switch their support to the government. A few religious leaders have also called on their supporters to not participate with the protests anymore."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.11.d:0 "The opposition was not impressed by the recent debate with the government at the National Assembly. Many accuse the government of backsliding on its duty to defend Islam. Indeed, some parliamentarians from the ruling coalition are now supporting the protestor demands."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.12.d:0 "During a recent National Assembly debate on resolving the current religious party protests, the government called on all members to look at the legacy of Quadi Azam. The government supporters noted Mohammad Ali Jinnah made strong efforts to guarantee the protection of minorities and ensure the unity of all Muslim communities. They also pointed out all elements of the constitution that confirm to the written wishes of the late founder. It was a powerful and moving presentation, though the opposition did try to counter by claiming the government was not providing a full account of the wishes of the beloved Quadi Azam."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.13.d:0 "After extensive debates, the government has proposed a new Minority Practices Protection Act to guarantee the rights of non-Muslim citizens in the country. More significantly, the act adds much stiffer penalties for those found guilty of forcibly converting non-Muslims. The proposal looks like it will pass easily and would mark a major blow for the religious protests. Privately, the opposition has approached the government, they want the bill to be withdrawn in exchange for an end to the protests. This would be a major victory, but some advisors urge the bill be passed. They note the offer reveals a weakness among the protestors and the government should press there advantage now."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.14.d:0 "A committee consisting of both government and opposition members submitted a report to change the wording of certain elements of the constitution. These changes plan on highlighting the importance of Islam to the people of Pakistan. More importantly, the constitution will now begin with Islamic invocations. The proposals are being opposed by secularists, but they are a clear minority. Even members sympathetic to secular ideals are supporting the measures as it does not fundamentally change the content or add new amendments."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.15.d:0 "It appears efforts to accommodate the opposition and religious party protestors are bearing fruit. The recent decision in parliament to initiate some changes to bring the government closer to an Islamic character are being praised. There are now opposition members supporting the government initiative on this matter. More significantly, some of the more popular religious leaders are calling on their supporters to halt the protest campaign as changers are occurring."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.16.d:0 "Our efforts to accommodate the demands of religious protestors and the opposition is not having the desired effect. Our recent efforts are being seen as superficial. Protest leaders are claiming the government is misleading the public and not going far enough in its proposals. The narrative increasingly is that the government wishes to trick the general public by pretending to care about initiating true Islamic reforms."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.17.d:0 "Previous attempts to pass anti-alcohol or anti-gambling laws often failed to reach a vote. Many in the National Assembly viewed the issue of alcohol consumption a private matter among individuals that did not require legislation. The resistance to expanding colonial era anti-gambling laws were driven by economic considerations. There are casinos and plans to build new casinos that will cater to foreign tourists. Passing strict gambling laws would be detrimental to this effort. However, the recent national protests by Islamic religious leaders have persuaded the government that these issues matter to the people. There is a proposal on the floor to pass a comprehensive ban on alcohol consumption and sales to the Muslim community in Pakistan. In addition, there is a bill to expand colonial era anti-gambling laws, though with exceptions for foreigners."
 PAK_Religous_Upheaval.18.d:0 "A joint committee of the opposition and government recently explored a proposal for a new bill called the Shariat Court Act. This would satisfy the demands of Muslim religious leaders across the country. The bill calls for the establishment of a new Federal Shariat Court, with the leading ulema serving as judges. This court would review all proposed legislation and declare if it is in conformity to Islamic principles or not. If not, the bill would need to be withdrawn. The government has countered the proposal by suggesting the Federal Shariat Court should not be able to block any bills but instead provide an opinion on proposed legislation. The Prime Minister must pick which bill to support."

 PAK_1977_Elections.1.d:0 "The 1977 General Elections mark the first election under the new constitution. Voter turnout is expected to be high as the PPP launched an aggressive campaign to secure voters. The opposition parties have united to form the Pakistan National Alliance under famed opposition politician and anti-colonial activist Khan Abdul Wali Khan. In the leadup to the vote, PPP leader Zulfikar Bhutto held public rallies all over the country to broaden the base of PPP support. The PNA has used its alliance of regional and religious parties to launch a grassroots campaign condemning the PPP for corruption and a disastrous economic policy. It has been a bitter campaign with both sides exchanging harsh accusations against the other."
 PAK_1977_Elections.2.d:0 "It is clear the PPP will win a majority of seats for the election, securing another term for Zulfikar Bhutto as Prime Minister. In hindsight, it is actually very clear the PPP was likely to win over the PNA which failed to offer a concrete plan for governing Pakistan. The PPP electoral cell has received phone calls from certain party cadres who note there are a few seats with close races. They are asking for permission to help ensure the PPP candidates win those seats, in doing so we can enter parliament with a supermajority and not deal with delaying tactics from the opposition. This would greatly accelerate the PPP platform and transformation of Pakistan into the Islamic Socialist state it was always meant to be."
 PAK_1977_Elections.3.d:0 "Diplomatic Cable from American Ambassador to Pakistan: "I was invited to watch the electoral results with Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto at his residence. Once the tv broadcasts confirmed the PPP would win a majority, the room became jubilant and drinks were handed out to all attendees. However, within the hour, the mood of the Prime Minister soured. He saw results saying PPP candidates were winning seats by massive margins and were going to sweep a supermajority in parliament. The Prime Minister muttered curses and retired to his study where he was heard cursing his election cell leaders for being too zealous in ensuring the supermajority. He returned to the party but drank quietly and looked embarrassed as the results clearly indicate tampering had occurred during the election...""

 PAK_Contested_Elections.1.d:0 "The 1977 General Elections have been marred in controversy. The election results, with suspicious margins of victory and the gain of so many seats to the PPP have galvanized the opposition and PNA. Many observers believe the PPP did win a majority, but its efforts at securing a complete victory backfired and brought the whole election into chaos. The PNA is leading massive protests, strikes, and unrest as they demand the government resign and new elections be held. Prime Minister Bhutto is criticizing the PNA for being embarrassed at their poor performance and is condemning them for undermining the nation just to gain political points. The PNA says it will maintain a boycott of the National Assembly and provincial assemblies until the government resigns and new elections are held under the supervision of the Supreme Court."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.2.d:0 "We established the Federal Security Force to have a paramilitary force loyal to the Prime Minister and answerable to his orders. Since its founding we have ensured the FSF receives all the weapons they demand and provide their personnel better perks than even the military. We have staffed their officers with loyalists and Army officers retired for not fitting in the institution. With the rise of unrest following the election results, the National Security Advisor suggests we deploy the FSF into the major cities to reduce the constant street protests. Some advisors fear deploying the FSF may only end up enflaming the protestors and backfire."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.3.d:0 "The Federal Security Force battalions deployed to major cities have succeeded in reducing the street protests being organized by the opposition. Although the international press and those media outlets sympathetic to the opposition are criticizing the harshness of the crackdown, it has been a success. The FSF troops and their officers are carrying out their duties with zeal and dedication. The only concern we have heard is that Military Police units in the vicinity refused to offer any support to the FSF despite orders to aid in the restoration of law and order."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.4.d:0 "The Federal Security Force battalions deployed in major cities have been mostly driven out and forced back to their barracks. In many instances, when the FSF troops tried to break up the protestors, many more joined the streets and overwhelmed our troops. It appears our FSF forces were ill-prepared for street control and their officers often panicked. What is of more concern are rumors that when the FSF asked for backup from local police it did not materialize. When our officials reached out to local police for an explanation they were vague and we suspect the local military commanders threatened the police not to interfere."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.5.d:0 "The Pakistan Rangers are the largest paramilitary force in Punjab and Sindh. They are well-trained and equipped and officered by Pakistan Army officers. Our top security advisors believe the Rangers cannot be asked to crackdown on the opposition protestors. However, the public unrest has caused a spike in burglaries, robberies, and other crimes. Criminal groups are seizing the opportunity to run amok. The Prime Minister can ask the Interior Minister to order the Rangers to deploy. Some of the security advisors are urging we hold off calling on the Rangers as we cannot trust their officers will diligently carry out the orders."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.6.d:0 "The Interior Minister ordered the Pakistan Rangers to deploy and aid law enforcement in cracking down on the spike in crimes. Although the Rangers have obeyed the order and established roadblocks, it appears they have not made a significant difference. Crime is still running amok and now we are hearing complaints that the government is completely inefficient at ending this new crime wave. It appears that the Army officers commanding Ranger units are putting very little effort in carrying out their orders. They are putting the appearance of obeying directives but doing nothing."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.7.d:0 "The Interior Minister ordered the Pakistan Rangers to deploy and aid law enforcement in cracking down on the spike in crimes. The Rangers have carried out their orders diligently. Ranger troops have stormed suspected criminal hideouts and setup strategic checkpoints. This has resulted in a large number of arrests and confiscation of illegal weapons and drugs. Nearly a dozen illegal gambling dens have also been destroyed. The media is positively reporting on these actions and the crime wave is slowly subsiding. However, opposition papers are giving credit to the Army, not the government, regardless, increasing safety to citizens will help us in our efforts to restore orders."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.8.d:0 "The PNA protests and the unrest that has resulted has caused immense difficulties for the government. The law and order situation in the country continues to deteriorated and there are fears internationally that Pakistan faces the risk of civil war. Our feelers indicate the PNA is open to holding talks. Although they have maintained pressure on the government, their coalition has always been precarious, with many different parties trying to work together. Their leadership feels a resolution is needed soon. The cabinet suggests the Prime Minister hold talks, however, some other advisors believe the government should just hold on and wait till the PNA efforts finally lose momentum."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.9.d:0 "Zulfikar Bhutto dispatched his close advisors to hold talks with the PNA leadership in order to find a solution to the unrest. The PNA is outraged over the recent election, claiming it was massively rigged in favor of the PPP. However, privately, the PNA understands that the PPP remains a popular party with powerful cadres across the country. They are willing to accept a proposal for fresh elections to be held under a temporary government of technocrats. The only issue is how soon to hold the elections. Although a final resolution has not been made, it appears the talks are on the right track and some of the rhetoric of PNA leaders has toned down in their rallies."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.10.d:0 "Zulfikar Bhutto dispatched his close advisors to hold talks with the PNA leadership in order to find a solution to the unrest. The PNA is outraged over the recent election, claiming it was massively rigged in favor of the PPP. The talks however have largely stalled for several reasons. The PNA representatives are struggling to present a unified stance as it consists of multiple parties and interests. The PPP negotiators are not willing to concede their party would not have gained a majority without a majority. With the parties unable to even agree on a baseline, the talks are largely going nowhere. This has only agitated PNA leadership who have responded by escalating their rhetoric, especially to striking workers."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.11.d:0 "The Information Minister reported to Prime Minister Bhutto that his talks with representatives of the major newspapers were not encouraging. He emphasized to the papers that they had a role in aiding the government in curtailing the unrest. However, most of the publications insist they will only report on the news and are under no obligation to print reports favorable to the government. The only good news is that the media leadership also added that they are not particularly fond of some elements in the PNA and if there are any signs of positive changes, they will report on it fully as though they will not follow dictates from the government, they are aware of the dire situation facing the country."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.12.d:0 "Media reports in recent days have been largely positive. Insider sources from the PNA and PPP are both leaking information that recent talks were positive and a consensus appears on the horizon. With this news, the papers are also condemning lawlessness and especially divisive speeches by some of the more fringe PNA leaders. This is having a calming effect on the populous and there is a new sense of optimism in the air, which is refreshing. Prime Minister Bhutto has called his advisors together and insists they continue to push the country back towards reconciliation and stability."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.13.d:0 "Media reports in recent days have been largely negative. Insider sources, especially from the PNA have leaked news that talks held with the PPP are not going anywhere. This news has only increased the tensions in the country and has invigorated enemies of the government to criticize the PPP for seeking to turn Pakistan into a one party dictatorship. The Interior Minister has directed local authorities to confiscate and shutdown papers deemed to be inciting riots, but this is not being carried out fully. In addition, this has sparked new protests by those who claim the government is now enforcing censorship."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.14.d:0 "Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto announced that after negotiations, the PPP and PNA have agreed on a solution to the contested election. Bhutto noted that he and his senior party leadership were not aware of any irregularities during the last election but noted their might have been issues at the polls by overzealous activists. He insisted the PPP had nothing to lose as they were the voice of the people and he looked forward to new elections. The PNA leadership held its own press conference and noted in three months new elections will be held and praised the people of Pakistan for their fight to restore democracy to the nation. Prime Minister Bhutto shortly thereafter resigned and handed power to a caretaker government of neutral technocrats to govern until elections are held. Many in the country welcome a return to normalcy."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.15.d:0 "After a vigorous three months of campaigning, the people of Pakistan are once again voting. The turnout is expected to be high as Pakistan must decide between the PPP and PNA. The PPP was accused of rigging the last election, however, its leadership has insisted the claims are overrated and for the sake of the nation they agreed to new elections. PPP leader Zulfikar Bhutto confidently informed reporters he had no hesitation in holding fresh elections as the PPP is the voice of the people. The PNA opposition leadership also expressed optimism, claiming it was them and the people who forced the PPP to restore democracy in the country. They campaigned on a promise for a more Islamic state that better reflects the desires of all Pakistanis, not just those in cities. Critics fear the PNA coalition maybe too unwieldly to govern, but they did lead the national protests against the last election results and are favored by many observers."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.16.d:0 "General Zia ul-Haq and his top generals launched an operation to remove Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto from power and institute martial law across Pakistan. Pakistanis in the capital and major cities woke up to find armed troops occupying key government buildings and surrounding the homes of senior government officials. General Zia himself met with Zulfikar Bhutto and insisted the measures were temporary and would only last until order could be restored. The now former Prime Minister is being taken to a villa located in a popular hill station for the time being. In an address to the nation, General Zia insisted the Army only acted to preserve the integrity and unity of Pakistan."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.17.d:0 "With promises of fresh elections, the military government released former Prime Minister Bhutto, only after he promised to not undermine the regime and acknowledge he understood the coup was necessary. However, since his release, Bhutto has traveled across the country by railroad, addressing massive crowds. In his speeches he condemns the military coup and demands elections be held as soon as possible. He has also promised that when he returns to power, those who violated the constitution by supporting the coup will be punished. These speeches are agitating the masses and undermining General Zia as he tries to unite the country."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.18.d:0 "In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court accepted the argument that General Zia ul-Haq had to launch his coup due to the doctrine of necessity. This ruling legitimizes the military takeover and will halt calls for military officers to be prosecuted for violating the constitution which specifically bans the overthrow of any elected government. Critics to the military regime, especially PPP leaders are condemning the ruling, claiming the justices are being unduly influenced by the military to rule in its favor. General Zia in his own statement welcomed the court ruling as proof of the legitimacy of his actions."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.19.d:0 "The Martial Law regime formally brought charges against former Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto and arrested him. Ahmed Raza Kasuri accuses Bhutto of killing his father who died in a botched assassination attempt that Bhutto allegedly orchestrated. Bhutto denies the charges as politically motivated. The trial is expected to begin in a month at the Lahore High Court. The lawyers representing Bhutto noted there was no evidence beyond witness testimonies which are questionable at best. The government responded by saying the prosecution has a strong case and no one is above the law in Pakistan."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.20.d:0 "The trial of Zulfikar Bhutto has begun. The former Prime Minister is accused of orchestrating an assassination attempt against the Kasuri family. Bhutto is said to be confidence as he has assembled a top rate legal tea. However, it is quickly apparent the judges appear biased against Bhutto as they continuously prevent defense objections and are allowing testimony from witnesses who recanted testimonies after being detained by military authorities. Bhutto is telling any who will listen that once he is out of prison again, he will punish those involved in these legal cases and General Zia. For his part, General Zia insists on making no statement and leaving the matter to the courts."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.21.d:0 "The Lahore High Court reached a verdict in the case of Zulfikar Bhutto. Bhutto was found not guilty in directly committing the attack on the Kasuri family, but due to his association to the plot, the court sentenced him to death. Almost immediately the defense lawyers of Bhutto condemned the decision and are appealing for the Pakistan Supreme Court to throw out the death sentence. Both the defense lawyers and international observers noted the trial appeared largely irregular and biased against Bhutto. The judges threw out evidence presented by the defense and emptied the court room when Bhutto asked to speak. Many Pakistanis believe General Zia ul-Haq and his military regime are influencing the trial behind the scenes. Angry crowds of PPP supporters took to the street in response. General Zia announced he will have to postpone planned elections until law and order can be ensured."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.22.d:0 "After nine months, the Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled to uphold the death sentence passed against Zulfikar Bhutto. The vote was passed 4-3 amidst accusations that the judges were being controlled by the military regime of General Zia ul-Haq. The attorneys for Bhutto note that many of the justices are directly connected to Zia. They also claimed the length it took for an appeal hearing was also a reflection of government interference. The military regime also issued a gag order on the rejoinder written by Bhutto against his charges. Finally, the Supreme Court took months to pick up the case with many Pakistanis believing the delay was due to most judges being in favor of acquittal. Only after Zia ensured enough judges would uphold the conviction, then he allowed the trial to continue. Despite the death sentence, the lawyers have filed fresh appeals and are calling on friends of Bhutto to demand the sentence at the very least be changed to a life in prison."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.23.d:0 "General Zia ul-Haq announced that he was a servant to the courts and his government carried out justice, following news that Zulfikar Bhutto was executed in Rawalpindi early in the morning. The execution took place despite the pleas of many international leaders and prominent Pakistani leaders. Nations like Saudi Arabia and Jordan promised to host Bhutto in exile. However, General Zia was unfazed and once the appeals were completed, the execution was carried out. Pakistan is said to be at a standstill, with most citizens stunned by the news that the charismatic leader of the popular PPP party is no more. Many PPP leaders have vowed revenge and several leading organizations condemned the action. However, analysts note that General Zia had long concluded that if he let Bhutto live, he risked his own life as Bhutto long promised to punish the generals who launched the coup and remained a popular national leader. Opposition for future elections are also low."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.24.d:0 "The decision by the military to level charges against Zulfikar Bhutto has provoked young leftists, especially university students, to begin organizing into resistance cells. Many of these young people are escaping the cities for the hills of Baluchistan, to hide out among the historically independent tribal peoples. Although the resistance has not formally established a leadership structure, its supporters call themselves fighters for Al-Zulfikar. They demand the restoration of democracy and punishment for those who pervert it."
 PAK_Contested_Elections.25.d:0 "Supporters of the Al-Zulfikar movement confirmed the organization has essentially ceased to function. It appears there was a violent power struggle among senior leaders abroad. Many members, fearing reprisals, have chosen to return home. The Al-Zulfikar movement failed to develop a coherent message or expand its base beyond leftist university students. The organization did launch several attacks but failed to truly challenge the Pakistan military. Several attempts at launching large attacks on Pakistan military posts resulted in heavily losses for the rebels. Returning members blame Pakistan intelligence agencies for causing the recent leadership tensions by planting false rumors."
