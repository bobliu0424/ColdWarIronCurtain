 NLF_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mosin-Nagant is a Russian Imperial bolt-action rifle used by the Russian Empire and was based off a design imported from France. In 1889, the GAU (Ministry of Defense of the Russian Empire) acquired the Lebel-1886 from France and sought to improve its design. Various Russian scientists and engineers were hired by the ministry and led by Captain Sergei Mosin and Leon Nagant to improve it and produced the Mosin Nagant after a long series of trials and prototypes. In 91, 1891, the bolt-action of Mosin's design was ordered into production. The rifle has a long disassembly time but is notable for its high accuracy. It was used extensively in the Russo-Japanese war, WWI, the civil war within the Russian Empire that led to the formation of the Soviet Union, WWII, and numerous worldwide conflicts."

 NLF_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 NLF_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "AKM"
 NLF_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

 NLF_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Avtomat Kalashnikova 1974"
 NLF_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "AK-74"
 NLF_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74."

 NLF_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "STL-1A"
 NLF_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "In 2015, the Z111 Factory announced that they would produce the new STL-1A rifle. This would mainly be done through converting and upgrading the old AKMs under the new name, but they would also produce entirely new STL-1A rifles. The updated rifle included New polymer handguards, a folding buttstock, a new ergonomic pistol grip, and an updated muzzle brake similar to those found on the AK-74. A notable change was that it also allowed the use of M203 grenade launchers that are also being produced in Vietnam, replacing the GP-25/GP-34 grenade launchers on the original AKMs. The rifle however, still uses the dovetail side-mount for attaching sights. Overall, the rifle highly resembles an AK-103."

Similarity to the famous Lavochkin La-7 was only superficial – the new fighter had an all-metal construction and a laminar flow wing. Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948."

Produced in limited numbers, it was used to bomb Berlin in August 1941. It was also used for so-called "morale raids" designed to raise the spirit of the Soviet people by exposing Axis vulnerabilities. Its primary mission, however, was to attack German airfields, rail yards and other rear-area facilities at night. Because these aircraft were morale boosters, the German Luftwaffe often targeted these, with a large number being destroyed over the course of the Great Patriotic War. After the war, they served largely as transports until the late 1950s."

Despite the U.S. refusal to Lend-Lease the B-29, four B-29s crash landed in Soviet territory, and that was enough to begin the reverse-engineering process. Despite many difficulties (procuring parts that were equivalent or superior to American-developed parts, conversion from imperial to metric system, etc.) the Tu-4's first flight and entry into service was enough to panic the U.S. and Great Britain, the first of many during the Cold War. It would have a brief service life however, replaced by jet bombers by the mid-1960s. Its NATO reporting name is Bull."

It could carry up to 9,000 kg (20,000 lbs) of ordinance, including nuclear weapons and the FAB-9000, a 9,000 kg bomb with a yield similar to the British Grand Slam bomb. Known in the West as the Badger, the type served throughout the Cold War, retiring in 1993. China's license-built variant, the H-6, remains in service as the PLAAF's frontline strategic bomber."

 NLF_team_weapons_1_desc: "The SG-43 is a medium machine gun developed by PM Goryunov to replace the out-of-date, by WWII standards the PM M1910 MG was used by the Soviet Union in most of the war. The SG-43 used a tilting breechblock and came with an apparatus on the bottom that allowed to to be mounted on tripods, wheeled mounts, or on vehicles as a support weapon. The barrel is air-cooled and very dense making it difficult to cool in most temperatures but comes with a chromium-plated bore that can sustain them. This makes it unreliable in higher temperatures. It saw heavy usage around the end of WWII. It has been licensed to vast numbers of countries resulting it it seeing combat in the Korean and Vietnam wars. Although the weapon itself also has a track record of being involved in many, many civil wars.\nThe M1938 mortar is a 120mm soviet mortar used heavily by the Soviet army during WWII. Its design is a near-copy of the French Mortier Brandt de 120mm. The mortar itself is very easy to limber and unlimber and could move around quickly to avoid counter fire. It uses very heavy 120mm shells and had a high rate of fire, making it a strong weapon for hitting enemy encampments or infantry in heavy cover such as buildings."

 NLF_team_weapons_2_desc: "The KPV is a heavy machine gun designed for the Soviets in 1944 by Semen Vladimirov. It was not brought into production or service until 1949. The gun itself was eventually taken out of infantry service in the mid 1960s for its immense weight and replaced with an alternate HMG. It is notorious for its exceptional 3000 meter horizontal range and 2000 aerial range. Its heavy caliber could also make it useful a light anti-armor weapon and was placed on scout cars and BTRs. It saw usage during the Korean and Vietnam war and its hand down leasing has led these weapons to see combat in many different wars. Even today, the gun itself has not yet been taken out of service and has seen modern conflicts such as the Gulf and Iraq wars.\nThe 120-PM-43 mortar was a 120mm muzzle loaded breech Soviet mortar developed in 1943 and was a modified version of the M1938. Its design was heavily simplified and its weight and costs were vastly reduced. It was used in the end of WWII and saw soviet usage in the Afghanistan wars as well as Vietnam and the Gulf war."

Although it has less range than the KPV, the gun itself has a few advantages including weighing much less, allowing it to continue to be used as an infantry HMG and greater levels of versatility. It was also known to be more reliable and cheaper to manufacture, allowing for an overall improvement as an infantry HMG. It saw combat in the Afghan and Vietnam wars as well as both Iraq wars and the Syrian Civil war.\nThe ASG-17 is a heavy automatic grenade launcher designed by KBP in 1967. It is designed to operate from a vehicle or fortified position. The standard drum can contain up to 29 grenades and can fire all of them in 10 seconds. It has been used extensively by the Soviet Union and it demonstrated considerable reliability in Afghanistan."

The NSVT featured improvements such as lighter weight from simplified parts and more modernized materials to allow the weapon to sustain fire for longer. It was also around this time that various attachments were developed for the HMG. The NSVT is well known for being mounted on Soviet MBTs such as the 64, the 72, and the 80.\nThe 2B14 is a modern light indirect fire mortar designed in 1983 by the Nizni Novgorod Engineering Plant for use in airborne and light infantry forces. The weapon fires a 82mm modern mortar and has a fire rate of approximately 24 rounds per minute. Its high rate of fire and efficient logistical design made it an excellent weapon for the Soviets and saw usage well outside its intended purpose including motor rifle units. Its success was seen largely during the Afghan war."

The weapon has extensive changes over the former NSVT including a rotating bolt replacing the pivoting breech lock, an improved gas system, and reworked muzzle baffle. The gun has much less recoil giving it higher accuracy and longer sustained fire times, making it better for suppressing fire and long range fire support. It is also vastly lighter and produces a higher volume of fire. It has seen combat in a large variety of modern Russian and Russian-sphere conflicts including the Russo-Georgian war and the Syrian Civil war. There are also reports that it has been seen in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with the US albeit rarely.\nThe ASG-30 is a heavy grenade launcher developed in 1990 by the KBP bureau for the Soviet Union but was not adopted until after the dissolution in 1995 by the Russian federation. It fires at a rate of 400 rounds per minute and is equipped with a blowback action. Its design is based heavily off of the AGS-17 and is massively lighter, more mobile, has a longer range, and is more accurate. The launcher has gained notable prestige in its capability to take down fortified enemies. Its capability was proven in the second Chechen war where it proved to be a highly capable weapon."

Around WWI after the tank entered the battlefield, miniaturized rounds were created. Eventually, small AP calibers were created as an answer to body armor. Modern AP ammunition in 1965 was created as an answer to an increase in heavily armored infantry and infantry cover. The TM landmines are a series of Soviet anti-tank blast mines initially developed and widely used around 1941 but were discontinued due to a metal shortage that was prioritized to create other weapons. However, around 1957, they made a comeback and development and production of the TM mines were continued eventually using more modern explosives. TM mines saw frequent use almost wherever there was Soviet sphere conflict but their full potential was witnessed around the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan."

Modern AP rounds are far better at penetrating targets than older AP rounds and can reach higher velocities. Modern alloys allow standard ammunition to deal more damage to a target. Frangible bullets or incendiary rounds have special situations in which they are useful. Additionally, shotguns can have improved usability in modern combat with HE rounds, 000 ammunition, flechette rounds, or incendiary shots."

It is far more capable of penetrating armor than the RPG-7 although it did not entirely faze out the RPG-7 or the RPG-18 due to its higher cost. The RPG-29 also does not have an initial propellant charge to protect the operators as the rocket ignites in order to reduce weight and give more valuable weight value that can be used for more rocket fuel.

Instead of proportional navigation logic, the Strela-3 used infrared homing to hit targets far beyond the effective range of the Strela-2. Additionally, it came with a detector element cooler in the missile itself, allowing it to be less easily fooled by flares and more accurately seek out true targets. Despite this, the additions made the missile heavier and require a more expensive propulsion fuel, making each round more expensive.
