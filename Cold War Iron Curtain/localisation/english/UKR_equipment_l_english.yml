 UKR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mosin-Nagant is a Russian Imperial bolt-action rifle used by the Russian Empire and was based off a design imported from France. In 1889, the GAU (Ministry of Defense of the Russian Empire) acquired the Lebel-1886 from France and sought to improve its design. Various Russian scientists and engineers were hired by the ministry and led by Captain Sergei Mosin and Leon Nagant to improve it and produced the Mosin Nagant after a long series of trials and prototypes. In 91, 1891, the bolt-action of Mosin's design was ordered into production. The rifle has a long disassembly time but is notable for its high accuracy. It was used extensively in the Russo-Japanese war, WWI, the civil war within the Russian Empire that led to the formation of the Soviet Union, WWII, and numerous worldwide conflicts."

 UKR_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 UKR_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "AKM"
 UKR_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

 UKR_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "AK-74"
 UKR_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74."

 UKR_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The AK-74M is an improved variant of the AK-74 developed in 1991 by the Izhmash factory. The AK-74M was developed to incorporate new materials and manufacturing advances to create an improved weapon. It features a lightened bolt and carrier that reduces the recoil produced by the gas piston. The rifle also includes a glass-filled polyamide stock that can side-hold, an improved muzzle, reinforced cover, and several other minor improvements. It also comes with a rail for mounting optics. The lightened, strengthened rifle was easier to handle and carry and improved support for attachments. It did not see adoption by the Soviet Union as the USSR had crumbled before it could be considered, however, it has been adopted by the Russian Federation."

 UKR_mbt_equipment_0_desc:0 "The T-34 is a Soviet medium tank that revolutionized the field of tank design and is well known for its reliability. The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided. The T-34 became the second most produced tank in the world but one of the most important in WWII. T-34s are still being used by insurgents and poorer nations today."
 UKR_mbt_equipment_1:0 "T-44"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_1_short:0 "T-44"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_1_desc:0 "The T-44 is a medium Soviet tank made closer to the end of WWII. It provided improved mobility and greater armor with a heavier 85mm main gun. It was designed by AA Morozov in 1944 however few were built as the tank was seen as too expensive for what advantages they provided. Only 2000 were built before production switched back to the T-34."
 UKR_mbt_equipment_2:0 "T-54"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_2_short:0 "T-54"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_2_desc:0 "The T-54 tank was the most produced tank in history. The tank was designed in 1946 by by KMBD. The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it. "
 UKR_mbt_equipment_3:0 "T-55"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_3_short:0 "T-55"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_3_desc:0 "The T-55 is an improved version of the T-54 tank. OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "
 UKR_mbt_equipment_4:0 "T-62"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_4_short:0 "T-62"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_4_desc:0 "The T-62 is a further development of the T-55 tank. The T-62 uses a smoothbore gun and has slightly thicker armor. The main gun was also upped to 115mm. It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east. Its improvements displayed a slightly greater capability in 1969 in the Sino-Soviet border conflict. "

 UKR_mbt_equipment_5_short:0 "T-64A"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_5_desc:0 "The T-64 is a Soviet MBT that introduced numerous modernizations over the T-62 and can be called a continuation of the improvements made from the T-55 to the T-62. It features a more compact engine, composite armor, improved engine auxiliaries, and a 125mm main gun with an autoloader. Designed in 1962 by KMBD, the tank itself featured many improvements over its predecessor but at substantially higher costs. The engine was a 5TDF 5-cylinder diesel engine that enabled greater operational range and higher speeds. It was intended to be scrapped, but was kept in production by its chief designer's political clout. Alexander Morozov, the chief designer, argued that in spite of its costs, it was a notably greater design that was worth it. This showed to not be the case in the war in Donbass and the war in Transnistria. It was replaced with the vastly more cost effective T-72. "

 UKR_mbt_equipment_6_short:0 "T-72"
 UKR_mbt_equipment_6_desc:0 "The T-72 is a Soviet MBT created as a new generation of tanks, mostly to replace the T-62 and its expensive counterpart the T-64. It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

It is one of the loudest military aircraft due to the tips of the propeller blades moving faster than the speed of sound. Just like the American B-52 Stratofortress, the bomber the Tu-95 is often compared to. The Tu-95 is slated to remain in Russian Aerospace service until well into the 2040s.
